## What is a Liquor License?

A liquor license is a permit issued by the government for businesses to
sell, manufacture, store, or otherwise use alcoholic beverages.[^1]

## How does it connect to LGBTQ discrimination in New York City/within the US?

The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA), after Prohibition, refused to
issue permits to places where homosexuals were known to congregate, and
if bars were found to be homosexual hot spots, their licenses would be
removed, and they would often be raided. George Chauncey, in his book
*Gay New York*, describes in detail the process of using licensing as a
form of regulation and discrimination on pages 336-352. He says, "The
genius of the licensing mechanism lay in the way it expanded the state
ability to survey and regulate public sociability" because "not only
bars but also most restaurants, nightclubs, and cabarets depended on
liquor sales to make a profit, the strategy allowed the state to police
most of the most common sites of urban sociability."[^2] The legislation
backing the SLA did not specify that homosexuality was banned from bars
it required "establishments be orderly" and the SLA determined that "the
simple presence of lesbians or gay men" made a business disorderly.[^3]
Police officers and SLA officials would investigate bars and clubs,
watching for potential violations of homosexual conduct, and if the
establishment was found to either be supportive of the behavior or
ignoring it, the SLA would shut the establishment down and revoke its
license. This authority shut down hundreds of gay-friendly
establishments in New York, and all of its actions for decades were
supported by the courts, leaving the closed establishments with no way
of reopening without promising to ban homosexuals.

## Examples of what happened during SLA investigations/raids/court hearings

George Chauncey wrote in detail about two different stories about SLA
anti-gay policies, which are quoted below. The first story is about the
closure of Gloria's, a gay bar on Third Avenue at Fortieth Street, in
1939, and the second is about the license revoking of the Times Square
Bar and Grill in the same year.

### Gloria's:

*"The owners had made it apparent they wanted to run it as a gay bar by
hiring Jackie Mason as its manager. Mason was a well-known figure in gay
circles, who had run a gay speakeasy on Charles Street in the mid-1920s
(where Jean Malin once worked), had organized the Madison Square Garden
drag ball in 1930, and since then had regularly arranged drag shows for
both gay and , straight clubs. As one SLA investigator put it, Mason was
'a fag and a leader of that element ... where Jackie Mason is, fags
are'; he was a popular man and a sure draw as a host. Gloria’s was part
of a gay bar circuit that included Benny’s, a block to the south; Will
Finch described both bars in the spring of 1939 as 'very crowded, almost
exclusively with homosexuals.' Men felt free to camp it up at Gloria’s.
They 'gabbed around in feminine voices,' it seemed to one SLA
investigator. 'Some called others by feminine names. \[They\] acted,
walked, and 7 impersonated females, and \[female\] attitude and
gestures.' It was precisely this openness that aroused the ire of the
police and SLA. The SLA warned Gloria’s management that they had
endangered their license by 'permit\[ting\] the premises to become
disorderly in permitting homosexuals, degenerates and undesirable people
to congregate on the premises.' As the SLA indicated at a hearing, it
based this judgment on its investigators’ reports that the bar had hired
Mason to attract a gay following and that the men they had seen at the
bar behaved in a campy (or “feminine”) manner. The SLA also specified
two particular incidents of disorderly conduct witnessed by its agents:
a man the agents had invited to the bar had, after a two-hour
conversation in a booth, caressed (or 'fondled,' as they put it) one of
the agents under the table; and the management had permitted two
heterosexual couples to goose several homosexual men who had passed by
them in the crowded bar. The SLA also alleged that two men had solicited
the investigators and that one had offered to arrange a date between an
investigator and two 'degenerates.' The SLA initially agreed to renew
Gloria’s license on the condition that it ban homosexuals from the
premises. When the management failed to evict its homosexual patrons,
the Authority not only revoked the owner’s license, but prohibited the
licensing of the premises - to anyone else for a year, thus making it
virtually impossible for the owner to recoup his original investment by
selling his equipment."*[^4]

[^4]: Chauncey, *Gay New York* 338.

*The owner's of the bar, unlike many other gay bar owners, took the SLA
to court arguing that they had not violated the regulations through
attempting to challenge the process the SLA went through to determine
who was a homosexual. When that failed they attempted to challenge the
policy itself claiming that "the Liquor Authority could not require a
bar's management to 'refuse to serve such people' because there was no
written section of the law that stated 'a sex variant may not be served
at a licensed premises.'"*[^5] Both arguments failed and the court
upheld the decisions of the SLA which created a precedence for all
future cases.

### Time Square Bar and Grill:

*"The fate of the Times Square Garden & Grill is worth detailing, for it
illustrates even more effectively than Gloria’s the range of agencies
involved in the regulation of bars and the steps they were willing to
take to rid commercial establishments of homosexuals. The owner of the
Times Square, Morris Horowitz, had not sought a gay. patronage, even
though his bar was located on a block (Forty-second Street — between
Seventh and Eighth Avenues) that by the mid-thirties had — become a
major center of gay bars and male prostitution. But his experience on
the Square had alerted him to the risk posed by the gay men who suddenly
appeared in his bar. He had seen the SLA close the Barrel ‘House and
numerous other neighborhood bars, and he knew that the \| advent of the
World’s Fair threatened to precipitate even greater police vigilance at
the same time that it promised huge profits to the businesses able to
cater to the tourist trade. 'You know what it means,' he , later pleaded
before the State Liquor Authority, 'if I should \[lose\] that place? ..
I know what it means to be on 42 Street in the World’s Fair. \~ Would I
take a chance for that?' He thus quickly contacted the police and
military, who he doubtless suspected were already aware of the
situation, for assistance in ridding his bar of the homosexuals. A
member of the police vice squad who had frequently dealt with 'fag
cases' visited the bar on two occasions and advised him to try to
discourage the gay men’s patronage by putting salt in their drinks or
refusing to serve them altogether. But the police and SLA also put the
bar under surveillance. An undercover SLA agent who visited the bar
filed reports noting that while he had overheard both the manager and
bartender indicate their desire to rid the bar of 'fags,' they had not
in fact done so. The plainclothes policemen who visited the bar used
their usual methods to secure definitive evidence that the bar was
frequented by 'degenerates': they struck up conversations with the other
patrons, made arrangements to go home with several of them, and then
arrested them as they left the bar, charging them with 'degenerate
disorderly conduct.' (Five patrons were arrested and convicted; some had
their sentences suspended, others spent sixty days in the workhouse.)*

*A week later, while the bar was still under surveillance by the police
and SLA, army officers inspected the premises at the request of the
manager and were sufficiently alarmed by the mixing of soldiers and
'fairies' there that they raided the bar the following evening (again
with the cooperation of the manager) and ordered every soldier to leave.
The owner may have thought that this drastic tactic had solved his
problem, but he then somehow discovered that the authorities had put his
bar under surveillance, despite his efforts to cooperate with them, and
he began to panic. After identifying one of the plainclothesmen in the
bar, he warned several gay patrons to avoid him, a fact duly noted by
the plainclothesman he had not recognized. In retaliation, the police
raided the bar, evicted its patrons, and forced it to close. They agreed
to let it reopen only on the condition that a uniformed policeman be
stationed on the premises to maintain order. Not surprisingly, the
policeman’s presence, the two raids, the eviction of the soldiers, and
the arrests of patrons by plainclothesmen had the intended effect on the
bar’s gay customers: they went away. Nonetheless, the Liquor Authority
still decided to revoke the bar’s license on the grounds that it had
allowed homosexuals and other people of 'questionable character' to
congregate on the premises. As a last-ditch effort to save his
investment, the owner appealed the revocation to the courts, but his
appeal did not question the SLA’s policy against bars that catered to
homosexuals. Both the SLA and the bar focused their arguments on whether
the manager had engaged in a 'good faith \[effort\] to eliminate this
condition and ... cooperate with the police authorities,' and the bar
owner lost.’*

*The Times Square Garden & Grill case illustrates the full range of
forces that could be brought to bear against gay bars in the city, the
extent of the SLA’s commitment to its anti-gay policy, and the futility
of most defense strategies available to such bars. It served to warn bar
owners that they did not need to cultivate a gay patronage in order to
suffer the SLA’s wrath: any bar that so much as tolerated the presence
of a single homosexual risked losing its license. And in conjunction
with the Gloria’s case, it demonstrated that bars had no legal defense
against this. policy because the SLA had the full support of the courts.
As a result, the SLA faced few legal challenges to its campaign against
gay bars for the next fifteen years. It regularly closed both bars that
had sought a gay clientele and bars that had served a single gay
patron."*[^6]

## How did queer establishments get around this restriction?

Gay bars and other re-purposed spaces did not disappear from the
cityscape when the SLA began their anti-gay crackdowns. However, their
existence became more hidden and guarded from the public eye. Gay bars
and other establishments that served homosexual clientele in the
post-WWII period were plentiful in the city. Still, due to the
crackdowns by the police and SLA, each location was often only open for
a short amount of time before being closed. Everyone had to find a new
location to use. Some places remained open longer because they either
created stringent rules for their patrons to follow inside the space so
there would be no cause to revoke their license or because they could
bribe the officers to disregard the activities and patrons in their
establishment. Chauncey and other scholars of urban gay history argue
that it was during this post-war period and the height of the SLA that
the queer world of New York City moved further underground, but it never
entirely vanished.[^7] The community had new rules, new re-purposed
locations, and new fears that motivated them to retreat from their
pre-war publicity.

Many New York gay bars during Prohibition up until around the 1970s were
owned and operated by the Mafia due to the discrimination against
homosexual men (and other queer groups) by police and the liquor
authorities. Due to the underground, secretive, and crime-entangled
nature of the Mafia, their ownership allowed gay bars to operate in
relative secret within the city, however their treatment of patrons and
often strict rules led to feelings of resentment from within the queer
community as the 1960s drew to a close. See the Background page to learn
more about the relationship the Mafia played in Stonewall!
