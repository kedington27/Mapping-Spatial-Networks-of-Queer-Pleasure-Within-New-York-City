<p>Below is a map of New York City (Manhattan) queer bars, clubs, bathhouses, and cruising locations open between 1970-1999. Some of the establishments were open before 1970 and many of them close after 1999 however these are the bounding years of my study so far. Below the map are detailed explanations of each location’s history. Enjoy!</p>

The Snake Pit was a gay bar most well known for the police raid that occurred on the property in 1970 that inspired the Gay Liberation Front along with other organizations to form a protest march. The police arrested 165 people and the injuries of one man who was impaled on a fence caused mass media coverage and protest over treatment of homosexuals and their establishments.</p></li>

<li><p>Twilo: 530 West 27th Street (10th Avenue), Chelsea. Twilo was a nightclub open from 1995 until 2001 when it finally lost its cabaret license due to the amount of drug overdoses and drug deals alleged to have occurred within the establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncle Charlie’s: 56 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich Village. Uncle Charlie’s was a gay video bar in operation from 1980 until 1997. It is most well known for the Islamic terrorist attack in 1990 when a pipe bomb was placed inside the bar and injured three men. It started a wave of protests about anti-gay discrimination and violence.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Continental Baths at the Ansonia Hotel: 230 West 74th Street, Upper West Side. The Continental Baths operated from 1968 until 1976. The owner Steve Ostrow sought to improve the bathhouse experience by adding dancing, private rooms, a cabaret stage, sauna rooms, waterfalls, a gym, bar, STD clinic and sun roof deck. The place closed 1976 due to lack of interest as it catered to more straight patrons and tourists instead of increasing opportunities for gay public sex.</p></li>
<li><p>Everard Baths: 28 West 28th Street, Chelsea. The Everard Baths was a famous and long-lasting bathhouse in New York City. It opened its doors in 1888 and closed in 1986. The site originally was a Turkish bathhouse open to all men but by WWI it was considered a refuge by gay men. It was closed in 1986 by the mayor as an anti-AIDS measure to stop the spread of the disease.</p></li>
<li><p>Mt. Morris Baths: 28 East 125th Street, Harlem. The Mt. Morris Baths was in operation under that name from the 1920s until 2003 and it served as the only gay African American bathhouse in the city prior to the 1960s. Originally called the Mayer Baths and catering to Jewish patrons by the 1920s it had been renamed and now served African American queer men. During the AIDS crisis it was one of the few bathhouses to remain open and it worked to educate its patrons about safe sex and discouraged public sex. It closed in 2003 due to claimed structural issues.</p></li>
<li><p>New St.&nbsp;Marks Baths: 6 St.&nbsp;Mark’s Place, East Village. The St.&nbsp;Marks Baths opened in 1915 and catered originally to male immigrants. Only in the 1950s do gay men appear to be a large clientele for the Baths only at night. By the 1960s it was a fully gay bathhouse known for being uninviting and dirty. Bruce Mailman in 1979 bought the Baths and hoped to turn the reputation around by renovating and renaming it the New St.&nbsp;Marks Bath that was open 24 hours a day. It became a massive bathhouse with spaces for swimming, relaxing, and having public group sex. During the AIDS epidemic the New St.&nbsp;Marks Baths stayed open until 1985 when the city ordered every bathhouse to be closed. In that time the bath worked to provide sex education materials and condoms while still providing a safe space for men to have their sexual relations outside their homes.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cruising-locations">Cruising locations:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Central Park: Central Park, Upper East Side and Upper West Side. Central Park was a known cruising spot for queer men since it opened in 1857 however by the 1970s and 80s it was also used by the gay community for Gay Pride Marches. While its status as a cruising location became less prominent by the 1970s and 80s it is hard to imagine that it stopped being used in such a way therefore it remains on the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Greenwich Village Waterfront: Christopher Street Pier, Greenwich Village. The Greenwich Village Waterfront was an active gay cruising site from WWI until the mid 1980s due to its location in Greenwich Village and its many private sections. Now it still is connected to the queer community through art projects, community activism and its status as a place for marginalized gay youth.</p></li>
