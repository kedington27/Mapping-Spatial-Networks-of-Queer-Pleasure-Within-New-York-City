This webpage serves as the second part of my MA portfolio project. 
In its current form it is a beginning of what the final project should be.
This is a website that will trace the history of queer spatial geography in New 
York City from the 1970s until 1999. 
I am interested in analyzing the locations of what Fiona Buckland called “third 
spaces” for queer people, especially gay bars, clubs, and bathhouses. 


The goal of the website is to understand the networks of queer pleasure, fun, 
and erotic encounters that work to protect, celebrate, and raise awareness of 
homosexual culture through viewing the locations of homosexual establishments 
and identities within the urban environment. 


In its final form the website will trace the openings, closings, and relocating 
or negotiations occurring within the city at the time to show the attempts by the 
dominant society to limit queer spaces, representation, and culture. 
It does this via mapping and adding descriptions of the establishments. Currently 
the map is static with only a few locations listed but hopefully in the future 
there will be an interactive feature to the map that will link pages about each 
location to the main map.

This project took influence and hopes to contibute to the ongoing mapping efforts 
by other sites like https://www.queermaps.org/about and  https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/theme/bars-nightlife/
