This webpage serves as the second part of my MA portfolio project. 
In its current form it is a beginning of what the final project should be.
This is a website that will trace the history of queer spatial geography in New 
York City from the 1970s until 1986. 
I am interested in analyzing the locations of what Fiona Buckland called “third 
spaces” for queer people, especially gay bars, clubs, bathhouses, bookstores, 
cinemas, restaurants, sex stores, backrooms, and cruising locations.


The map and the companion text-based pages are an extension of my paper’s 
argument that safer sex education during AIDS was negotiated, contested, and 
implemented in public queer spaces by queer actors. It further visually supports 
and provides context for the acts of discrimination and general public health 
debates that impacted queer communities and establishments before and during 
AIDS. It visually argues that the government was both slow to shut down 
bathhouses and backrooms during AIDS and that it continued to use tactics of 
licensing and rezoning to discriminate against the queer community before, 
during, and after the peak of AIDS.


In its final form the website will trace the openings, closings, and relocating 
or negotiations occurring within the city at the time to show the attempts by the 
dominant society to limit queer spaces, representation, and culture. 
It does this via mapping and adding descriptions of the establishments. Currently 
the map is static with only a few locations listed but hopefully in the future 
there will be an interactive feature to the map that will link pages about each 
location to the main map.

This project took influence and hopes to contibute to the ongoing mapping efforts 
by other sites like https://www.queermaps.org/about and
