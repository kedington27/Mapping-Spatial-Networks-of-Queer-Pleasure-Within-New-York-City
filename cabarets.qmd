## What is a Cabaret License?

A cabaret license is a license for a place that sells food and drink
while having an orchestra or any type of live entertainment or where
dancing is permitted. The license provides permission for the business
to operate with live music, dancing, and drinking.[^1]

## How does it connect to LGBTQ discrimination in New York City/within the US?

Cabaret licenses were created in the 1920s during Prohibition in New
York City to restrict racial intermixing via dancing and other
"inappropriate" social dancing behaviors within unlicensed businesses.
Like with liquor licenses, places without a valid cabaret license, if
caught allowing people, especially mixed race or same-sex couples, to
dance or play live music while also selling food, would be at risk of
closure. Equally, locations with licenses would be at risk of losing
them if caught allowing "undesirable" behaviors within their
establishments. In the later 1900s, after the legalization of
interracial marriage and relationships, cabaret licenses became more of
a way to restrict LGBT businesses from remaining open or allowing
physical touch within their grounds. By the 1990s, the use of these
licenses in the city against LGBT people and spaces was at its peak
through rezoning efforts and reclassification of areas as non-cabaret
zones. This law allowed gay people to use spaces. Still, it restricted
their use of their bodies within the space because there were cases
where even touching when music was playing was considered to violate the
restrictions.[^2]

## How did queer establishments get around this restriction? How was it enforced within New York?

Queer establishments in the city worked around this restriction in
various ways, including compliance, operating in relative secrecy, and
outright protest of the licensing policies. Many businesses chose to
comply with the rules. They stated that violations by patrons would have
them removed from the property, similar to liquor license compliance.
Others decided to allow patrons to dance or play music or both and
blacked out the windows or did other things to hide the inside of the
establishment from onlookers while also often using code words to warn
patrons when police were entering or planning to stop by to protect both
the patrons and the business from punishment. Lastly, some businesses
and people, especially towards the 1990s and into the 2000s, began to
increasingly voice their protests about the use of the license as a form
of discrimination and unlawful regulation of people's culture and
sexuality. These protests included writing pamphlets, protesting
legislation, directly violating the law, and creating organizations
based around ending this discrimination, such as the DANCE PARADE ·
DANCE LIBERATION NETWORK · People's CULTURAL PLAN HOUSE COALITION · THE
FLOASIS · COLOR OF CHANGE · LEGALIZE DANCE · DANCE NYC. The police
enforced the cabaret licensing restrictions, often banning musicians
from playing at certain establishments or closing venues due to
non-compliance.

## Is this type of regulation still around today?

This type of regulation is no longer in use within New York City. In
2017, the city repealed the Cabaret Licensing Law that had been enacted
under Prohibition, so now there is no need for establishments to obtain
a cabaret permit to have live music or dancing while also selling
drinks.[^3] The license in modern times was seen as a hassle for
businesses to go through rather than a potentially discriminatory
regulation on queer and "rowdy" establishments the way it was during the
1920s until the late 1900s. It is interesting to note that this
regulation was repealed after the 2012 legalization of gay marriage at a
federal level, and it likely influenced the end of cabaret licensing in
the city.
