## What is a Cabaret License?

A cabaret license is a license for a place that sells food and drink while having 
an orchestra or any type of live entertainment, or where dancing is permitted. 
The license provides permission for the business to operate with live music,
dancing, and drinking.[^1]

## How does it connect to LGBTQ discrimination in New York City/within the US?

    -   Use Chauncey and Buckland

-   An example/story about the use of this type of regulation quoted
    from George Chauncey, Fiona Buckland or from a newspaper article or
    other primary sources

    -   Need to find this

## How did queer establishments get around this restriction? How was it enforced within New York?

    -   And this

## Is this type of regulation still around today?

This type of regulation is no longer in use within New York City. In 2017 the 
city repealed the Cabaret Licensing Law that had been enacted under Prohibition,
so now there is no need for establishments to go through the process of obtaining 
a cabaret permit in order to have live music or dancing while also selling drinks.
The license in modern times was seen as a hassle for businesses to go through 
rather than a potentially discriminatory regulation on queer and "rowdy" 
establishments the way it was during the 1920s until the late 1900s.
