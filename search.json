George Chauncey in his book Gay New York describes in detail the process of using licensing as a form of regulation and discrimination on pages 336-352. He says “The genius of the licensing mechanism lay in the way it expanded the states ability to survey and regulate public sociability” because “not only bars but also most restaurants, nightclubs, and cabarets depended on liquor sales to make a profit, the strategy allowed the state to police most of the most common sites of urban sociability.”2 The legislation backing the SLA did not specify that homosexuality was banned from bars it required “establishments be orderly” and the SLA determined that “the simple presence of lesbians or gay men” made a business disorderly.3 Police officers and SLA officials would investigate bars and clubs watching for potential violations of homosexual conduct and if the establishment was found to either be supportive of the behavior or ignoring it the SLA would shut the establishment down and revoke its license. This authority shut down hundreds of gay friendly establishments in New York and all of its actions for decades were supported by the courts leaving the closed establishments with no way of reopening without promising to ban homosexuals.",

    "text": "Examples of what happened during SLA investigations/raids/court hearings\nGeorge Chauncey wrote in detail about two different stories about SLA anti-gay policies that are quoted below. The first story is about the closure of Gloria’s which was a gay bar on Third Avenue at Fortieth Street in 1939 and the second is the license revoking of the Time Square Bar and Grill in the same year. (for the final I will put more of this into my own words/analysis)\n\nGloria’s:\n“The owners had made it apparent they wanted to run it as a gay bar by hiring Jackie Mason as its manager. Mason was a well-known figure in gay circles, who had run a gay speakeasy on Charles Street in the mid-1920s (where Jean Malin once worked), had organized the Madison Square Garden drag ball in 1930, and since then had regularly arranged drag shows for both gay and , straight clubs. As one SLA investigator put it, Mason was “a fag and a leader of that element … where Jackie Mason is, fags are”; he was a popular man and a sure draw as a host. Gloria’s was part of a gay bar circuit that included Benny’s, a block to the south; Will Finch described both bars in the spring of 1939 as “very crowded, almost exclusively with homosexuals.” Men felt free to camp it up at Gloria’s. They “sabbed around in feminine voices,” it seemed to one SLA investigator. “Some called others by feminine names. [They] acted, walked, and 7 impersonated females, and [female] attitude and gestures.”” It was precisely this openness that aroused the ire of the police and SLA. The SLA warned Gloria’s management that they had endangered their license by “permit[ting] the premises to become disorderly in permitting homosexuals, degenerates and undesirable people to congregate on the premises.” As the SLA indicated at a hearing, it based this judgment on its investigators’ reports that the bar had hired Mason to attract a gay following and that the men they had seen at the bar behaved in a campy (or “feminine”) manner. The SLA also specified two particular incidents of disorderly conduct witnessed by its agents: a man the agents had invited to the bar had, after a two-hour conversation in a booth, caressed (or “fondled,” as they put it) one of the agents under the table; and the management had permitted two heterosexual couples to goose several homosexual men who had passed by them in the crowded bar. The SLA also alleged that two men had solicited the investigators and that one had offered to arrange a date between an investigator and two “degenerates.” The SLA initially agreed to renew Gloria’s license on the condition that it ban homosexuals from the premises. When the management failed to evict its homosexual patrons, the Authority not only revoked the owner’s license, but prohibited the licensing of the premises - to anyone else for a year, thus making it virtually impossible for the owner to recoup his original investment by selling his equipment.”4\nThe owner’s of the bar, unlike many other gay bar owners, took the SLA to court arguing that they had not violated the regulations through attempting to challenge the process the SLA went through to determine who was a homosexual. When that failed they attempted to challenge the policy itself claiming that “the Liquor Authority could not require a bar’s management to ‘refuse to serve such people’” because there was no written section of the law that stated “a sex variant may not be served at a licensed premises.”5 Both arguments failed and the court upheld the decisions of the SLA which created a precedence for all future cases.\n\n\nTime Square Bar and Grill:\n“The fate of the Times Square Garden & Grill is worth detailing, for it illustrates even more effectively than Gloria’s the range of agencies involved in the regulation of bars and the steps they were willing to take to rid commercial establishments of homosexuals. The owner of the Times Square, Morris Horowitz, had not sought a gay. patronage, even though his bar was located on a block (Forty-second Street — between Seventh and Eighth Avenues) that by the mid-thirties had — become a major center of gay bars and male prostitution. But his experience on the Square had alerted him to the risk posed by the gay men who suddenly appeared in his bar. He had seen the SLA close the Barrel ‘House and numerous other neighborhood bars, and he knew that the | advent of the World’s Fair threatened to precipitate even greater police vigilance at the same time that it promised huge profits to the businesses able to cater to the tourist trade. ’You know what it means,’ he , later pleaded before the State Liquor Authority, ‘if I should [lose] that place? .. I know what it means to be on 42 Street in the World’s Fair. ~ Would I take a chance for that?’ He thus quickly contacted the police and military, who he doubtless suspected were already aware of the sit- uation, for assistance in ridding his bar of the homosexuals. A member of the police vice squad who had frequently dealt with ‘fag cases’ visited the bar on two occasions and advised him to try to discourage the gay men’s patronage by putting salt in their drinks or refusing to serve them altogether. But the police and SLA also put the bar under surveillance. An undercover SLA agent who visited the bar filed reports noting that while he had overheard both the manager and bartender indicate their desire to rid the bar of ‘fags,’ they had not in fact done so. The plainclothes policemen who visited the bar used their usual methods to secure definitive evidence that the bar was frequented by ‘degenerates’: they struck up conversations with the other patrons, made arrangements to go home with several of them, and then arrested them as they left the bar, charging them with ‘degenerate disorderly conduct.’ (Five patrons were arrested and convicted; some had their sentences suspended, others spent sixty days in the workhouse.)\nA week later, while the bar was still under surveillance by the police and SLA, army officers inspected the premises at the request of the manager and were sufficiently alarmed by the mixing of soldiers and ‘fairies’ there that they raided the bar the following evening (again with the cooperation of the manager) and ordered every soldier to leave. The owner may have thought that this drastic tactic had solved his problem, but he then somehow discovered that the authorities had put his bar under surveillance, despite his efforts to cooperate with them, and he began to panic. After identifying one of the plainclothesmen in the bar, he warned several gay patrons to avoid him, a fact duly noted by the plainclothesman he had not recognized. In retaliation, the police raided the bar, evicted its patrons, and forced it to close. They agreed to let it reopen only on the condition that a uniformed policeman be stationed on the premises to maintain order. Not surprisingly, the policeman’s presence, the two raids, the eviction of the soldiers, and the arrests of patrons by plainclothesmen had the intended effect on the bar’s gay customers: they went away. Nonetheless, the Liquor Authority still decided to revoke the bar’s license on the grounds that it had allowed homosexuals and other people of ‘questionable character’ to congregate on the premises. As a last-ditch effort to save his investment, the owner appealed the revocation to the courts, but his appeal did not question the SLA’s policy against bars that catered to homosexuals. Both the SLA and the bar focused their arguments on whether the manager had engaged in a ‘good faith [effort] to eliminate this condition and … cooperate with the police authorities,’ and the bar owner lost.’\nThe Times Square Garden & Grill case illustrates the full range of forces that could be brought to bear against gay bars in the city, the extent of the SLA’s commitment to its anti-gay policy, and the futility of most defense strategies available to such bars. It served to warn bar own- ers that they did not need to cultivate a gay patronage in order to suffer the SLA’s wrath: any bar that so much as tolerated the presence of a single homosexual risked losing its license. And in conjunction with the Gloria’s case, it demonstrated that bars had no legal defense against this. policy because the SLA had the full support of the courts. As a result, the SLA faced few legal challenges to its campaign against gay bars for the next fifteen years. It regularly closed both bars that had sought a gay clientele and bars that had served a single gay patron.”6",

    "text": "How did queer establishments get around this restriction?\nGay bars and other re-purposed spaced did not disappear from the cityscape when the SLA began their anti-gay crackdowns, however their existence became more hidden and guarded from the public eye. Gay bars and other establishments that served homosexual clientele in the post WWII period were plentiful in the city, but due to the crackdowns by the police and SLA each location was often only open for a short amount of time before being closed and everyone had to go find a new location to use. Some places remained open longer because they either created very strict rules for their patrons to follow inside the space so that there would be no cause to revoke their license or because they were able to bribe the officers to turn a blind-eye to the activities and patrons in their establishment. Chauncey and other scholars of urban gay history argue that it was during this post war period and the height of the SLA that the queer world of New York City moved further underground, but it never fully vanished.7 The community just had new rules, new re-purposed locations, and new fears that motivated them to retreat from their pre-war publicity.\nFurthermore many New York gay bars during Prohibition and up until before the 1970s were owned and operated by the Mafia due to the discrimination by police and the liquor authorities. Due to the underground, secretive, and crime-entangled nature of the Mafia their ownership allowed gay bars to operate in relative secret within the city, however their treatment of patrons and often strict rules led to feelings of resentment from within the queer community as the 1960s drew to a close.",

    "text": "This webpage serves as the second part of my MA portfolio project. In its current form it is a beginning of what the final project should be. This is a website that will trace the history of queer spatial geography in New York City from the 1970s until 1986. I am interested in analyzing the locations of what Fiona Buckland called “third spaces” for queer people, especially gay bars, clubs, bathhouses, bookstores, cinemas, restaurants, sex stores, backrooms, and cruising locations.\nThe map and the companion text-based pages are an extension of my paper’s argument that safer sex education during AIDS was negotiated, contested, and implemented in public queer spaces by queer actors. It further visually supports and provides context for the acts of discrimination and general public health debates that impacted queer communities and establishments before and during AIDS. It visually argues that the government was both slow to shut down bathhouses and backrooms during AIDS and that it continued to use tactics of licensing and rezoning to discriminate against the queer community before, during, and after the peak of AIDS.\nIn its final form the website will trace the openings, closings, and relocating or negotiations occurring within the city at the time to show the attempts by the dominant society to limit queer spaces, representation, and culture. It does this via mapping and adding descriptions of the establishments.\nThis project took influence and hopes to contribute to the ongoing mapping efforts by other sites like https://www.queermaps.org/about and https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/theme/bars-nightlife/",

    "text": "When was AIDS first “discovered” in America?\nAIDS was first “discovered” in America in 1981, however we have evidence that shows AIDS/HIV had been in the United States since the late 1970s.2 AIDS is believed to have come from Africa where it had been in existence for decades in remote areas. The people there called it the wasting disease. One of the first known Western cases was Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor, who worked in Zaire Africa during the 1970s. By 1976 she was very ill in Africa and by November 1977 she was forced to fly back to Denmark where she died of Pneumocysitis carinii (a type of pneumonia that typically was not deadly) on December 12, 1977.3\nIn the US some of the earliest cases within the homosexual population can be traced back to 1979 according to Randy Shilts, IV drug addicts around the same time began documenting cases of what they called “junkies pneumonia.” It was first officially written about in an MMWR report in June of 1981 titled “Pneumocystis pneumonia in homosexual men— Los Angeles” which reported on five cases of the illness in the LA area. It was then followed by “Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men – New York and California” in July of the same year. However, in these early reports the focus is on the strange illnesses these young gay men were succumbing to as AIDS itself was unknown at the time the only thing doctors did understand was that the immune systems of these men were almost non-existent. Diseases like Kaposi’s Sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis were therefore considered opportunistic infections that were the cause of death but not the underlying issue behind these men’s health problems. It was not until the mid-1980s that the HIV virus was identified as the cause of AIDS.4",

    "text": "How did the queer community react to it in the early days?\nIn the early days of the AIDS epidemic the queer community was divided in its reaction. For those already infected or who knew of other infected friends and lovers the early period from 1980 until 1983 or so was one of great fear and loss but also one of activism and action to create support networks, hotlines, research funds, and safe sex education that would hopefully slow down transmission. These early activists in New York City include names like Larry Kramer a gay playwright who founded the GMHC (Gay Mens Health Crisis) and ACT UP during AIDS, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz who were some of the earliest pioneers of gay safer sex education along with Callen being the face of PWA (People With AIDS) and founding his own self help group called PWAS, and other early GMHC members like Paul Popham who was their first President.\nHowever, in these early years the vast majority of the gay population of New York City was a mix of unaware or in denial about the seriousness of AIDS due to mixed press coverage, lack of government intervention, and the feeling of gay liberation and being young and invisible. These men took longer to convince that AIDS was a big deal but through organizations like GMHC by 1983/84 more gay men were aware of the epidemic and most men began to know people who died which also increased awareness and fear. The community during this period generally came together and worked to support those with AIDS while also trying to keep people safe without knowing how the virus spread.",

    "text": "How did scientists react to it in the early days?\nScientists at the CDC and doctors who served large gay populations in NYC and California were called into action very early on during the AIDS epidemic. The CDC was there from day one of the MMRW report and doctors like (insert guy from San Fran) and Joseph Sonnabend were some of the first to report cases and attempt treatment of the opportunistic infections. The CDC in the first few years spent its time doing epidemiology research to track and determine possible causes for the virus along with researching in labs causes and potential treatments. Their early theories are listed below but because their focus was on gay men and when they interviewed these men and found out that they were all highly sexually active and also did drugs most of the early theories focused on drug use and “promiscuity.” Their interviewing while at times misleading did lead CDC scientists to hypothesize that the disease was spread through sexual contact and more specifically through bodily fluids like blood. Doctors in the early period attempted treatment and accepted patients in high numbers, however as cases continued to rise and AIDS was connected to gay men some hospitals stopped accepting patients with AIDS symptoms which led to increased discrimination and medical issues for PWA.\nAt the same time, the stigma AIDS gained made some scientists wary of working on the disease and made the government reluctant to provide funding to the CDC, NIH, and other hospitals and scientists for research. These set backs frustrated scientists at the CDC like Don Frances and Robert Gallo at the NIH because it delayed crucial progress when the government had previously thrown money into research about toxic shock syndrome and Legionaries disease quickly because those diseases were not associated with a minority group that had significant stigma attached to it during a conservative time in American history. However by the end of 1983 Robert Gallo had identified HIV as the cause of AIDS and by 1984/5 the public was also aware of this development.",

    "text": "How did the government react to it in the early days?\nThe best way to describe government reactions to the early AIDS crisis is that there was really no major reaction. The government was aware of AIDS in 1981, however Ronald Reagan had just taken office and the government itself was leaning far more conservative in the years leading up to AIDS with the rise of the Moral Majority to power and the failures of Jimmy Carter at the end of the 70s. Gay rights and protections of homosexuals was far down on the list of priorities for Reagan and his staff when AIDS hit the news. The government provided some money and resources to the CDC and other researchers but it was slim.\nThe President and his staff offered no public statements on the epidemic until the late 1980s leaving many AIDS patients and their friends and family feeling neglected by the government and local AIDS organizations were founded to fill the needs of the people that the government was ignoring but these organizations were often overwhelmed by the needs of PWA during the early years. The government also released no advice about prevention or treatment outside of CDC publications which caused mass confusion and ignorance in the years that it mattered most as even though a few gay men put out their own advice about AIDS prevention and public health actions, such as the need to close bathhouses, most people were skeptical to make changes without scientific and governmental proof. The Surgeon General Everett Koop did not release advice on AIDS to the general public until 1988 when he pushed for publication of the pamphlet “Understanding AIDS” that caused him major backlash within the Republican Party.",

    "section": "What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?",
    "text": "What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?\nPoppers: The CDC in the early days of their investigation in 1981 proposed the theory that poppers might be linked to AIDS. This conclusion was made because all of the first reported cases that they saw as linked were gay men who upon their interviews admitted to “sexual promiscuity” along with taking party drugs and sex aids like poppers. Poppers are inhaled and are known to relax muscles and to create a short lived high for users. They mess with the blood stream and veins so the CDC thought prolonged use might cause KS to develop, which was a common symptom in early patients. This theory remained in circulation until 1983 (but 84 for the general public) when it was determined that AIDS was caused by the HIV virus. However, some people still attribute poppers to KS and AIDS.\nPromiscuity: This early theory is linked to the theory for poppers. The CDC in the early days thought that “sexual promiscuity” along with poppers might be the cause of AIDS because so many of the early men they interviewed stated that they had sex with hundreds to thousands of men during their lifetime. This theory is also linked to the multi-causal theory that remained prominent for the first few years of AIDS before it was determined to be a virus, however high amounts of sexual contact is a main way the virus is spread but it is not the cause of HIV.\nBlood/Bodily Fluids/Virus: As early as the beginning of 1982 the CDC had a working theory that the disease was a virus transferred via blood and/or bodily fluids because they began witnessing cases of blood transfusion recipients contracting the disease along with babies and hemophiliacs. However, they only had circumstantial evidence that this hypothesis was correct and so they were stuck in limbo with this solid working theory until someone could find the viral agent and prove it causes the same symptoms as the disease. Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier both were working in their separate labs to find the virus and both were successful in 1983/84. There is some contention about who discovered it first but in the end they were determined to be co-discoverers of the virus and by 1984/5 the public was aware that the disease was caused by HIV therefore making it a viral illness that could potentially be treated with medicine that was then under development.\nMulti-causal through various STI’s: This theory was very popular from around 1982 until 1984 or so. The idea was that because gay men were having so many sexual partners and experiences and also contracting multiple STI’s over and over again that eventually these infections all damage the immune system of the person which then caused the immunodeficiency that we now know as HIV/AIDS. The theory was pushed by Dr. Joseph Sonnabend and his two patients Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen in their safer sex pamphlet “How to have Sex in an Epidemic” because to them it made more sense to get this illness after multiple sexual encounters over a long period of time rather than it only taking one sexual encounter to catch a virus. While they were proven wrong in 1985 with the discovery of the HIV virus, Callen and others remained skeptical that HIV was the true cause of their plight and continued to push for and believe in the multi-causal theory claiming that the virus theory had too many holes and was not backed by enough evidence.\nDrugs: Similar to the poppers theory there was a connection early on between party drugs, street drugs, and HIV/AIDS due to the groups who got the disease in 1981: gay men and IV drug users. There was a belief that maybe some kind of drug did something to the immune system or that a batch of drugs was tainted which caused this mass string of illnesses. Like poppers this line of inquiry remained in public discourse for years but it lost credibility in scientific circles when no tainted drugs were found and other evidence like babies and blood transfusion recipients also contracting HIV/AIDS emerged.\nMore obscure theories about Haitian pigs, mental illness, and self hatred: TBD",

    "text": "How do public sex establishments fit into the picture?\nThe use of these spaces (Bathhouses, sex clubs, backroom bars, etc.) became a debate about public health and personal freedoms that was at its height from 1982/3 until 1985/6 although the debate continued on into the 1990s. Since the earliest days of the queer community in cities gay men had found safety and each other in nightlife spaces, by the end of WWII spaces were created that were gay only bars and bathhouses for the first time increasing the feelings of safety within the spaces. Although the spaces were often raided and closed and people arrested there was a feeling of safety in numbers and for bathhouses starting around the 1950s they were finally a place where men could have sex with other men without having to risk public sex like cruising or have to bring them home which many men could not do. By the 1970s and gay liberation this history of gay bars and bathhouses was ingrained in the community and these places were viewed both as sexual havens but also as a core part of the gay experience and history. However, the opening of the proverbial closet in the 1970s due to Stonewall and consumer marketing towards gay men led to a mass influx of new establishments created for sexual encounters along with the traditional bars and while innovative many of these locations were dirty, poorly run, and by the 1980s men could have dozens of sexual encounters in one night due to mass gay migrations to cities and the ease of access to other willing men in bathhouses and backrooms. When AIDS emerges these places are hot spots for the spread of the disease due to the unsafe nature of the encounters and the number of men who used them.",

    "text": "Closing public sex establishments as a Public Health measure defended:\nThe arguments for closure of public sex establishments, specifically bathhouses, began in full by 1982 with the disease running rampant in California and New York. In 1982 Don Frances and other scientists from the CDC had pushed the hypothesis that AIDS was spread through sexual contact most likely via bodily fluids. Scientists like Selma Dritz began advocating for closure of bathhouses to newspapers and gay men because the baths were “biological cesspools for infection,” but her early calls fell on deaf ears.5 Other officials also made calls for bathhouse closure in California and New York like Ruth Silver who stated “if you’re saying that this can be spread through sexual contact, it makes sense to me to have the public health department get a court order to shut down the gay bathhouses. That would probably save lives.”6 Her words like those of Dritz were rejected and ignored. Months later other politically active San Francisco gay men like Bill Kraus, Clive Jones, and Ron Huberman took it upon themselves to write a piece for publication that aimed to be a wake up call to the community to join together to fight the disease while also protecting themselves by shutting down the baths or adopting safer sexual habits. In New York City the gay community was not quite as politically active as in San Francisco, however they too were fighting within themselves for bathhouse closure. The earliest safer sex calls came from Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen in New York with their first article coming out in the fall of 1982 titled “We Know Who We Are” that was a call to gay men to stop unsafe sex and bathhouse use and they received intense backlash.7 Their second attempt was a pamphlet in 1983 that taught men how to use safer sex techniques and broke down what was safe and what was risky including warning men about bathhouses. Larry Kramer, another major figure in New York queer circles was extremely vocal about the need to close bathhouses and to limit sexual contacts as a way to save lives. Later in the debates Callen and Kramer become leading voices in New York as they pushed to make gay men see the risks of baths remaining open and unchanging in their health standards. Their goal was to protect the community and to get the community to seek closure which would pressure the government to shut down the baths.",

    "section": "Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:",
    "text": "Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:\nThe personal freedoms/civil liberties argument was also presented around 1982 when scientists and government officials first started looking at potential closure of bathhouses. These early opinions that closure would be a violation of gay men’s civil liberties were expressed by gay men as well as government officials and bathhouse owners. In 1982 all parties who argued bathhouses should remain open defended them because at the time the cause of the disease was still unknown and the CDC and other scientist’s recommendations for closure were only based on a theory with little concrete proof. Therefore public health officials and the mayors of New York City and San Franscico were unwilling to close the baths due to lack of evidence and the amount of protest coming from gay men. Even the GMHC in the early period refused to make a definitive statement about bathhouses and sexual habits to callers on their hotline instead opting to provide information but not make polarizing statements because they thought gay men got enough judgement from outside the community. The average bathhouse attending gay man in the early period rejected the idea of closing the baths because they believed they had a right to access these historically significant gay spaces and there was little proof that AIDS was caused by sex.\nOnce it was determined that HIV/AIDS was indeed spread by bodily fluids often through sex the advocates for keeping spaces open shifted their arguments to focus on repurposing the spaces and the safety the spaces offer gay men. These advocates offered forms of compromise including using the spaces for educational purposes to keep men safe but also allow them to continue their lifestyles, however bathhouse owners, while in favor theoretically, often failed to make these changes because it would effect their profit margins. The other main arugment made for the personal freedom’s side is that these spaces provide a safe location to regulate sexual encounters that would otherwise happen elsewhere (the street, parks, or sex parties at people’s houses). This is in line with the historic intervention that bathhouses provided in gay communities because they were created and used as locations to move sexual encounters off the street to protect gay men from risky situations with the law. However, this argument was refuted by the other side that said no other location would offer the same conditions and number of men the way sex establishments did so through closure it would still reduce encounters by a significant amount. Despite these counterarguments the personal freedoms side remained strong well into the 1990s and they raised interesting points about the limits between personal choice and risk, community values and protections, and public health that are still issues today.8",

    "text": "Were there options to re-purpose public sex establishments within the queer community?\nThe short answer is yes there were options proposed within the queer community to re-purpose public sex establishments like bathhouses and backroom bars during the height of the AIDS epidemic. One option that was talked about mainly by the pro-public sex side of the debate was the option for increased regulation of these spaces ranging from workers who would keep an eye on sexual activity and remove those who were being unsafe to turning more lights on so people could see if they were with someone with KS lesions. The other option that was offered and attempted was to use these sex locations as educational opportunities to teach gay men safer sex techniques.\nThe debates about closing bathhouses in New York City ended for a short time through the compromise created by the GMHC that proposed that bathhouses could operate with their support if they adopted safer sex practices and encouraged education and safety in their establishments starting in 1983/4. Many of the bathhouses agreed to this system that combined elements of both restriction and education. Michael Callen, once a frequent visitor to the baths, was tasked with conducting inspections of these establishments and grading them on their compliance. What you see below are photos of one of his inspection reports. The report shows that while there was some improvement in these locations displaying safer sex posters, offering condoms, turning on lights, and cleaning the majority of places were not holding up their end of the bargain because it was costing them customers. It is not for lack of trying that the bathhouses and backrooms were ultimately closed in 1985 in NYC as there were multiple attempts to have them regulated and made into safer spaces where sex could be had in safer but still erotic ways in places dedicated to homosexual safety.",

The attempts to use them for educational purposes by GMHC were successful sometimes and sometimes they were a bust. It was not for lack of trying that the attempts at compromise to keep these historic gay spaces open failed but rather because these business owners were unwilling to give up profits for philanthropic causes and gay men who went to the establishments were unlikely to listen to safer sex advice posters unless they were already scared or curious, especially by 1985. Leading figures in gay activism fought to get these locations closed even when there were moments of compromise and potential success with Michael Callen being one of the biggest proponents of closure. Due to intense pressure from both the scientific and queer communities by 1985 there was enough evidence for the major of New York to officially shut down the baths.",

Some of the establishments were open before 1970 and many of them close after 1999 however these are the bounding years of my study so far. Below the map are detailed explanations of each location’s history. Enjoy!"

    "text": "Is this type of regulation still around today?\nThis type of regulation is no longer in use within New York City. In 2017 the city repealed the Cabaret Licensing Law that had been enacted under Prohibition, so now there is no need for establishments to go through the process of obtaining a cabaret permit in order to have live music or dancing while also selling drinks. The license in modern times was seen as a hassle for businesses to go through rather than a potentially discriminatory regulation on queer and “rowdy” establishments the way it was during the 1920s until the late 1900s.",
