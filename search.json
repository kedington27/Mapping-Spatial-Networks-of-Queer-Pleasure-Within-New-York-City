    "text": "How does it connect to LGBTQ discrimination in New York City/within the US?\nThe New York State Liquor Authority (SLA), after Prohibition, refused to issue permits to places where homosexuals were known to congregate, and if bars were found to be homosexual hot spots, their licenses would be removed, and they would often be raided. George Chauncey, in his book Gay New York, describes in detail the process of using licensing as a form of regulation and discrimination on pages 336-352. He says, “The genius of the licensing mechanism lay in the way it expanded the state ability to survey and regulate public sociability” because “not only bars but also most restaurants, nightclubs, and cabarets depended on liquor sales to make a profit, the strategy allowed the state to police most of the most common sites of urban sociability.”2 The legislation backing the SLA did not specify that homosexuality was banned from bars it required “establishments be orderly” and the SLA determined that “the simple presence of lesbians or gay men” made a business disorderly.3 Police officers and SLA officials would investigate bars and clubs, watching for potential violations of homosexual conduct, and if the establishment was found to either be supportive of the behavior or ignoring it, the SLA would shut the establishment down and revoke its license. This authority shut down hundreds of gay-friendly establishments in New York, and all of its actions for decades were supported by the courts, leaving the closed establishments with no way of reopening without promising to ban homosexuals.",

    "section": "Examples of what happened during SLA investigations/raids/court hearings",
    "text": "Examples of what happened during SLA investigations/raids/court hearings\nGeorge Chauncey wrote in detail about two different stories about SLA anti-gay policies, which are quoted below. The first story is about the closure of Gloria’s, a gay bar on Third Avenue at Fortieth Street, in 1939, and the second is about the license revoking of the Times Square Bar and Grill in the same year.\n\nGloria’s:\n“The owners had made it apparent they wanted to run it as a gay bar by hiring Jackie Mason as its manager. Mason was a well-known figure in gay circles, who had run a gay speakeasy on Charles Street in the mid-1920s (where Jean Malin once worked), had organized the Madison Square Garden drag ball in 1930, and since then had regularly arranged drag shows for both gay and , straight clubs. As one SLA investigator put it, Mason was “a fag and a leader of that element … where Jackie Mason is, fags are”; he was a popular man and a sure draw as a host. Gloria’s was part of a gay bar circuit that included Benny’s, a block to the south; Will Finch described both bars in the spring of 1939 as “very crowded, almost exclusively with homosexuals.” Men felt free to camp it up at Gloria’s. They “sabbed around in feminine voices,” it seemed to one SLA investigator. “Some called others by feminine names. [They] acted, walked, and 7 impersonated females, and [female] attitude and gestures.”” It was precisely this openness that aroused the ire of the police and SLA. The SLA warned Gloria’s management that they had endangered their license by “permit[ting] the premises to become disorderly in permitting homosexuals, degenerates and undesirable people to congregate on the premises.” As the SLA indicated at a hearing, it based this judgment on its investigators’ reports that the bar had hired Mason to attract a gay following and that the men they had seen at the bar behaved in a campy (or “feminine”) manner. The SLA also specified two particular incidents of disorderly conduct witnessed by its agents: a man the agents had invited to the bar had, after a two-hour conversation in a booth, caressed (or “fondled,” as they put it) one of the agents under the table; and the management had permitted two heterosexual couples to goose several homosexual men who had passed by them in the crowded bar. The SLA also alleged that two men had solicited the investigators and that one had offered to arrange a date between an investigator and two “degenerates.” The SLA initially agreed to renew Gloria’s license on the condition that it ban homosexuals from the premises. When the management failed to evict its homosexual patrons, the Authority not only revoked the owner’s license, but prohibited the licensing of the premises - to anyone else for a year, thus making it virtually impossible for the owner to recoup his original investment by selling his equipment.”4\nThe owner’s of the bar, unlike many other gay bar owners, took the SLA to court arguing that they had not violated the regulations through attempting to challenge the process the SLA went through to determine who was a homosexual. When that failed they attempted to challenge the policy itself claiming that “the Liquor Authority could not require a bar’s management to ‘refuse to serve such people’” because there was no written section of the law that stated “a sex variant may not be served at a licensed premises.”5 Both arguments failed and the court upheld the decisions of the SLA which created a precedence for all future cases.\n\n\nTime Square Bar and Grill:\n“The fate of the Times Square Garden & Grill is worth detailing, for it illustrates even more effectively than Gloria’s the range of agencies involved in the regulation of bars and the steps they were willing to take to rid commercial establishments of homosexuals. The owner of the Times Square, Morris Horowitz, had not sought a gay. patronage, even though his bar was located on a block (Forty-second Street — between Seventh and Eighth Avenues) that by the mid-thirties had — become a major center of gay bars and male prostitution. But his experience on the Square had alerted him to the risk posed by the gay men who suddenly appeared in his bar. He had seen the SLA close the Barrel ‘House and numerous other neighborhood bars, and he knew that the | advent of the World’s Fair threatened to precipitate even greater police vigilance at the same time that it promised huge profits to the businesses able to cater to the tourist trade. ’You know what it means,’ he , later pleaded before the State Liquor Authority, ‘if I should [lose] that place? .. I know what it means to be on 42 Street in the World’s Fair. ~ Would I take a chance for that?’ He thus quickly contacted the police and military, who he doubtless suspected were already aware of the sit- uation, for assistance in ridding his bar of the homosexuals. A member of the police vice squad who had frequently dealt with ‘fag cases’ visited the bar on two occasions and advised him to try to discourage the gay men’s patronage by putting salt in their drinks or refusing to serve them altogether. But the police and SLA also put the bar under surveillance. An undercover SLA agent who visited the bar filed reports noting that while he had overheard both the manager and bartender indicate their desire to rid the bar of ‘fags,’ they had not in fact done so. The plainclothes policemen who visited the bar used their usual methods to secure definitive evidence that the bar was frequented by ‘degenerates’: they struck up conversations with the other patrons, made arrangements to go home with several of them, and then arrested them as they left the bar, charging them with ‘degenerate disorderly conduct.’ (Five patrons were arrested and convicted; some had their sentences suspended, others spent sixty days in the workhouse.)\nA week later, while the bar was still under surveillance by the police and SLA, army officers inspected the premises at the request of the manager and were sufficiently alarmed by the mixing of soldiers and ‘fairies’ there that they raided the bar the following evening (again with the cooperation of the manager) and ordered every soldier to leave. The owner may have thought that this drastic tactic had solved his problem, but he then somehow discovered that the authorities had put his bar under surveillance, despite his efforts to cooperate with them, and he began to panic. After identifying one of the plainclothesmen in the bar, he warned several gay patrons to avoid him, a fact duly noted by the plainclothesman he had not recognized. In retaliation, the police raided the bar, evicted its patrons, and forced it to close. They agreed to let it reopen only on the condition that a uniformed policeman be stationed on the premises to maintain order. Not surprisingly, the policeman’s presence, the two raids, the eviction of the soldiers, and the arrests of patrons by plainclothesmen had the intended effect on the bar’s gay customers: they went away. Nonetheless, the Liquor Authority still decided to revoke the bar’s license on the grounds that it had allowed homosexuals and other people of ‘questionable character’ to congregate on the premises. As a last-ditch effort to save his investment, the owner appealed the revocation to the courts, but his appeal did not question the SLA’s policy against bars that catered to homosexuals. Both the SLA and the bar focused their arguments on whether the manager had engaged in a ‘good faith [effort] to eliminate this condition and … cooperate with the police authorities,’ and the bar owner lost.’\nThe Times Square Garden & Grill case illustrates the full range of forces that could be brought to bear against gay bars in the city, the extent of the SLA’s commitment to its anti-gay policy, and the futility of most defense strategies available to such bars. It served to warn bar own- ers that they did not need to cultivate a gay patronage in order to suffer the SLA’s wrath: any bar that so much as tolerated the presence of a single homosexual risked losing its license. And in conjunction with the Gloria’s case, it demonstrated that bars had no legal defense against this. policy because the SLA had the full support of the courts. As a result, the SLA faced few legal challenges to its campaign against gay bars for the next fifteen years. It regularly closed both bars that had sought a gay clientele and bars that had served a single gay patron.”6",

    "text": "How did queer establishments get around this restriction?\nGay bars and other re-purposed spaces did not disappear from the cityscape when the SLA began their anti-gay crackdowns. However, their existence became more hidden and guarded from the public eye. Gay bars and other establishments that served homosexual clientele in the post-WWII period were plentiful in the city. Still, due to the crackdowns by the police and SLA, each location was often only open for a short amount of time before being closed. Everyone had to find a new location to use. Some places remained open longer because they either created stringent rules for their patrons to follow inside the space so there would be no cause to revoke their license or because they could bribe the officers to disregard the activities and patrons in their establishment. Chauncey and other scholars of urban gay history argue that it was during this post-war period and the height of the SLA that the queer world of New York City moved further underground, but it never entirely vanished.7 The community had new rules, new re-purposed locations, and new fears that motivated them to retreat from their pre-war publicity.\nMany New York gay bars during Prohibition up until around the 1970s were owned and operated by the Mafia due to the discrimination against homosexual men (and other queer groups) by police and the liquor authorities. Due to the underground, secretive, and crime-entangled nature of the Mafia, their ownership allowed gay bars to operate in relative secret within the city, however their treatment of patrons and often strict rules led to feelings of resentment from within the queer community as the 1960s drew to a close.",

This is a website that will trace the history of queer spatial geography in New York City from the 1970s until 1986. I am interested in analyzing the locations of what Fiona Buckland called “third spaces” for queer people, especially gay bars, clubs, bathhouses, bookstores, cinemas, restaurants, sex stores, backrooms, and cruising locations.\nThe map and the companion text-based pages are an extension of my paper’s argument that safer sex education during AIDS was negotiated, contested, and implemented in public queer spaces by queer actors. It further visually supports and provides context for the acts of discrimination and general public health debates that impacted queer communities and establishments before and during AIDS. It visually argues that the government was both slow to shut down bathhouses and backrooms during AIDS and that it continued to use tactics of licensing and rezoning to discriminate against the queer community before, during, and after the peak of AIDS.\nIn its final form the website will trace the openings, closings, and relocating or negotiations occurring within the city at the time to show the attempts by the dominant society to limit queer spaces, representation, and culture. It does this via mapping and adding descriptions of the establishments.\nThis project took influence and hopes to contribute to the ongoing mapping efforts by other sites like https://www.queermaps.org/about and https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/theme/bars-nightlife/",

    "text": "Stonewall 1969\nThe Stonewall Riots occurred from June 28th until July 3rd 1969 in and around the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a popular gay bar that had been in operation since 1967 but if had been a popular restaurant under the same name as early as the 1930s. Due to the ban on liquor licenses for establishments that served homosexuals by the State Liquor Authority the Stonewall Inn was operated by the mafia from 1967 up to the police raid and subsequent riots on the 28th of June. This was not the first time that Stonewall had been raided by the police but normally there was notice because the mafia often paid the police to provide a warning. However tensions had been brewing between the mafia owners and the queer clientele and between the police and both other parties. Gay men and other queer folk who went to the Stonewall Inn grew sick of following the strict guidelines set by the mafia owners that were enforced to protect the owners from losing their business because they were very restrictive. Meanwhile the police were trying to comply with anti-homosexual legislation and also were less and less influenced by the mafia as a whole which put mafia owned gay bars at risk as the 1960s moved forward. Below I am quoting a newspaper report on the initial night of the riots that was published in July of 1969 to provide an eye witness narrative of the event. I am choosing to do so because this primary source account can convey better emotional impact and detailed narrative outlines than me summarizing the event could present. It is important to highlight that gay men, gender nonconforming individuals, and transgender women were all vital participants in the Stonewall Riots and all of these groups used the Inn as a social safe space that was violated by the police. The events of the riots were a long time coming from decades of discrimination and mistreatment by mafia owners, police, and the government that built up into resentment and finally into political action.\n\n\nQuoted: Full Moon Over the Stonewall: Howard Smith’s Account of the Stonewall Riots\nDuring the “gay power” riots at the Stonewall last Friday night I found myself on what seemed to me the wrong side of the blue line. Very scary. Very enlightening.\nI had struck up a spontaneous relationship with Deputy Inspector Pine, who had marshalled the raid, and was following him closely, listening to all the little dialogues and plans and police inflections. Things were already pretty tense: the gay customers freshly ejected from their hangout, prancing high and jubilant in the street, had been joined by quantities of Friday night tourists hawking around for Village-type excitement. The cops had considerable trouble arresting the few people they wanted to take in for further questioning. A strange mood was in the crowd — I noticed the full moon. Loud defiances mixed with skittish hilarity made for a more dangerous stage of protest; they were feeling their impunity. This kind of crowd freaks easily.\nThe turning point came when the police had difficulty keeping a dyke in a patrol car. Three times she slid out and tried to walk away. The last time a cop bodily heaved her in. The crowd shrieked, “Police brutality!” “Pigs!” A few coins sailed through the air. I covered my face. Pine ordered the three cars and paddy wagon to leave with the prisoners before the crowd became more of a mob. “Hurry back,” he added, realizing he and his force of eight detectives, two of them women, would be easily overwhelmed if the temper broker. “Just drop them at the Sixth Precinct and hurry back.”\nThe sirened caravan pushed through the gauntlet, pummeled and buffeted until it managed to escape. “Pigs!” “Gaggot cops!” Pennies and dimes flew. I stood against the door. The detectives held at most a 10-foot clearing. Escalate to nickels and quarters. A bottle. Another bottle. Pine says, “Let’s get inside. Lock ourselves inside, it’s safer.”\n“You want to come in?” he asks me. “You’re probably safer,” with a paternal tone. Two flashes: if they go in and I stay out, will the mob know that the blue plastic thing hanging from my shirt is a press card, or by now will they assume I’m a cop too? On the other hand, it might be interesting to be locked in with a few cops, just rapping and reviewing how they work.\nIn goes me. We bolt the heavy door. The front of the Stonewall is mostly brick except for the windows, which are boarded within by plywood. Inside we hear the shattering of windows, followed by what we imagine to be bricks pounding on the door, voices yelling. The floor shudders at each blow. “Aren’t you guys scared?” I say.\n“No.” But they look at least uneasy.\nThe door crashes open, beer cans and bottles hurl in. Pine and his troop rush to shut it. At that point the only uniformed cop among them gets hit with something under his eye. He hollers, and his hand comes away scarlet. It looks a lot more serious than it really is. They are all suddenly furious. Three run out in front to see if they can scare the mob from the door. A hail of coins. A beer can glances off Deputy Inspector Smyth’s head.\nPine, a man of about 40 and smallish build, gathers himself, leaps out into the melee, and grabs someone around the waist, pulling him downward and back into the doorway. They fall. Pine regains hold and drags the elected protester inside by the hair. The door slams again. Angry cops converge on the guy, releasing their anger on this sample from the mob. Pine is saying, “I saw him throwing somethin,” and the guy unfortunately is giving some sass, snidely admits to throwing “only a few coins.” The cop who was cut is incensed, yells something like, “So you’re the one who hit me!” And while the other cops help, he slaps the prisoner five or six times very hard and finishes with a punch to the mouth. They handcuff the guy as he almost passes out. “All right,” Pine announces, “we book him for assault.” The door is smashed open again. More objects are thrown in. The detectives locate a fire hose, the idea being to ward off the madding crowd until reinforcements arrive. They can’t see where to aim it, wedging the hose in a crack in the door. It sends out a weak stream. We all start to slip on water and Pine says to stop.\nBy now the mind’s eye has forgotten the character of the mob; the sound filtering in doesn’t suggest dancing faggots any more. It sounds like a powerful rage bent on vendetta. That way why Pine’s singling out the guy I knew later to be Dan Van Ronk was important. The little force of detectives was beginning to feel fear, and Pine’s action clinched their morale again.\nA door over to the side almost gives. One cop shouts, “Get away from there or I’ll shoot!” It stops shaking. The front door is completely open. One of the big plywood windows gives, and it seems inevitable that the mob will pour in. A kind of tribal adrenaline rush bolsters all of us; they all take out and check pistols. I see both policewomen busy doing the same, and the danger becomes even more real. I find a big wrench behind the bar, jam it into my belt like a scimitar. Hindsight: my fear on the verge of being trampled by a mob fills the same dimension as my fear on the verge of being clubbed by the TPF.\nPine places a few men on each side of the corridor leading away from the entrance. They aim unwavering at the door. One detective arms himself in addition with a sawed-off baseball bat he has found. I hear, “We’ll shoot the first motherfucker that comes through the door.”\nPine glances over toward me. “Are you all right, Howard?” I can’t believe what I’m saying: “I’d feel a lot better with a gun.”\nI can only see the arm at the window. It squirts a liquid into the room, and a flaring match follows. Pine is not more than 10 feet away. He aims his gun at the figures.\nHe doesn’t fire. The sound of sirens coincides with the whoosh of flames where the lighter fluid was thrown. Later, Pine tells me he didn’t shoot because he had heard the sirens in time and felt no need to kill someone if help was arriving. That was close.\nWhile the squads of uniforms disperse the mob out front, inside we are checking to see if each of us all right. For a few minutes we get the post-tension giggles, but as they subside I start scribbling notes to catch up, and the people around me change back to cops. They begin examining the place.\nIt had lasted 45 minutes. Just before and after the siege I picked up some more detached information. According to the police, they are not picking on homosexuals. On these raids they almost never arrest customers, only people working there. As of June 1, the State Liquor Authority said that all unlicensed places were eligible to apply for licenses. The police are scrutinizing all unlicensed places, and most of the bars that are in that category happen to cater to homosexuals. The Stonewall is an unlicensed private club. The raid was made with a warrant, after undercover agents inside observed illegal sale of alcohol. To make certain the raid plans did not leak, it was made without notifying the Sixth Precinct until after the detectives (all from the First Division) were inside the premises. Once the bust had actually started, one of Pine’s men called the Sixth for assistance on a pay phone.\nIt was explained to me that generally men dressed as men, even if wearing extensive makeup, are always released; men dressed as women are sometimes arrested; and “men” fully dressed as women, but who upon inspection by a policewoman prove to have undergone the sex-change operations, are always let go. At the Stonewall, out of the five queens checked, three were men and two were changes, even though all said they were girls. Pine released them all anyway.\nAs for the rough-talking owners and/or managers of the Stonewall, their riff ran something like this: we are just honest businessmen who are being harassed by the police because we cater to homosexuals, and because our names are Italian so they think we are part of something bigger. We haven’t done anything wrong and have never been convicted in no court. We have rights, and the courts should decide and not let the police do things like what happened here. When we got back in the place, all the mirrors, jukeboxes, phones, toilets, and cigarette machines were smashed. Even the sinks were stuffed and running over. And we say the police did it. The courts will say that we are innocent.\nWho isn’t, I thought, as I dropped my scimitar and departed.1",

    "text": "1970s = Welcome to Gay Liberation\nAfter the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and the national impact the riots had on queer communities, there was a push for increased political action by all members of the queer community. The 1970s were dominated by the Gay Liberation Movement that focused on pushing for equal rights for all sexualities (and often gender equality because many lesbians were also heavily involved in the feminist movement), opening up the community to remove a level of shame that the LGBTQ community felt, and to express sexual freedom and to enjoy a lifestyle that would have been impossible a generation prior. Various queer people interpreted this period differently. Some dove head into political action and led the charge of entering political lobbying and protesting. In contrast, others focused more on the new nightlife and lifestyle opportunities in large cities. Some people, of course, partook in both parts of the gay liberation movement. Still, typically, the West Coast was more interested in political action, and the East Coast was more into the sexual and commercial liberation that came with the 1970s, but both sides of liberation occurred nationally.\nThe sexual and commercial side of liberation was revolutionary and only possible because of the political advancement and the willingness of a large portion of the queer community to “come out” and open up their world to the public. During this time, there was a spike in queer establishments in large cities like New York and San Francisco that were no longer just based on socialization but on creating sexual encounters. The increased use and creation of bathhouses, sex clubs, and backrooms made nightlife in cities an unlimited sexual buffet of various men in various settings that had gay men migrating into cities and also vacationing to other cities across the United States and globally. This freedom to have sex and also to have public spaces only for them was thought to be well deserved after decades of shame, fear, guilt, and isolation, and many younger gay men flocked to cities to experience this new era of openness and sexual exploration. Nightlife boomed, and a new culture of appealing to gay men through sex via advertisements, consumer goods, and establishments was born. During the 1970s, within this sex liberation culture, there was very little thought about the consequences of the amount of unprotected sex that occurred and sex-based establishments that operated in large cities like New York, which became necessary for the transition into the 1980s and the spread of HIV/AIDS.",

    "text": "The 1980s: AIDS and Impact of the Liberation Spirit\nThe 1980s were both a continuation of the liberation spirit of the 1970s and a shift into another new era of queer history: the AIDS period. HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1981 in the United States. However, the spread most likely occurred during the 1970s through the increase in sexual partners and establishments that offered space for anonymous unprotected sexual encounters in cities like New York and San Francisco. Doctors during the 1970s and into the 1980s reported increasing numbers of gay men coming to them with STIs (sexually transmitted infections) multiple times. The reason for the large amounts of STIs and the repeated infections stemmed from both the number of partners men had sex with and that the sex was almost always unprotected (without condoms) because gay men saw condoms as unnecessary since they could not get pregnant and STIs were curable with pills. Some gay doctors like Dr. Joseph Sonnabend in New York worried that the number of infections would damage gay men’s immune systems or that a new STI would develop that would be more damaging and incurable during this period. Still, most gay men did not listen to doctor advice due to a historical distrust of medicine by the community.2 When HIV/AIDS first started appearing in 1981, these doctors had their worst fears realized. For many gay men as the 1980s went on, it felt as though the 1970s was a utopia that had been too good to be true, and new fears and restrictions bloomed in the community. Gay liberation, while it may have helped to bring an increase of the deadly epidemic to thousands of gay men, also provided gay men (and other allies) the tools to combat it as a community, provide education, and protest politically about the virus and the lack of governmental assistance.\nAs I mentioned in the 1970s section, there was a large migration of queer men to cities which helped re-open the queer community to the general public while also providing queer men access to a larger network of friends that, in turn, formed a stronger community by the time AIDS started appearing as a fatal illness for many gay men. While the community had been joined through sexual encounters and fighting for equality in the 1970s, in the 1980s, these early bonds changed to becoming networks of support for AIDS patients and organizations for advocacy, information, or political activism. Equally, the shift to advertising and commercializing sex in the 1970s was re-purposed in the 1980s to help organizations and advocates like GMHC (Gay Mens Health Crisis) and Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz educate gay men about the risks of unprotected sex and the ways that safer sex could save lives. GMHC focused on the concept of eroticizing safer sex through using erotic videos and basing the designs of their safer sex brochures on sex toy ads.3 Callen and Berkowitz attempted to rally and warn the community through their pamphlet and newspaper article using slang and erotic terminology instead of medical terms when discussing sex, which GMHC later incorporated the same technique in their own educational programming.4 The GMHC also, in the early period, sought to use public sex spaces like bathhouses and backrooms as locations to teach gay men the benefits of safer sex because they were spaces where sex occurred and, therefore, could help with reaching large numbers of men and showing that using condoms and other safer sex methods could still be considered desirable within these locations.5 The idea was if the places were to continue to exist, they should be places where gay men could make educated decisions. If sex became safer and was still viewed as erotic enough to keep baths in business, then AIDS would be reduced through educational methods created by gay men themselves. Finally, political groups like ACT UP in New York formed and developed tactics from those used by gay liberation protests along with those from the feminist and civil rights movements.6 Many of the members of ACT UP were not part of the previous 1960s and 70s movements but those who were brought knowledge of how to organize a group, how to get media attention, and most importantly, how to present a clear message about what a group is fighting to fix. ACT UP took elements from various movements and created a successful campaign to fight for treatment options, medical trial access, and reasonable costs for people with AIDS. While their protests often verged on the line of respectable and offensive, and their membership, like most large AIDS organizations, was predominantly gay white men with money, it is undeniable that ACT UP, through their use of gay liberation networks and techniques, made a significant impact on the development of treatment for AIDS much like how GMHC made significant strides in prevention education through the use of gay liberation commercialization and eroticization of sex.",

    "text": "When was AIDS first “discovered” in America?\nAIDS was first “discovered” in America in 1981. However, we have evidence that shows AIDS/HIV has been in the United States since the late 1970s.2 AIDS is believed to have come from Africa, where it has been in existence for decades in remote areas. The people there called it the wasting disease. One of the first known Western cases was Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor who worked in Zaire, Africa, during the 1970s. By 1976, she was very ill in Africa, and by November 1977, she was forced to fly back to Denmark, where she died of Pneumocystis carinii (a type of pneumonia that typically was not deadly) on December 12, 1977.3\nIn the US, some of the earliest cases within the homosexual population can be traced back to 1979. According to Randy Shilts, IV drug addicts around the same time began documenting cases of what they called “junkies pneumonia.” It was first officially written about in an MMWR report in June of 1981 titled “Pneumocystis pneumonia in homosexual men— Los Angeles,” which reported on five cases of the illness in the LA area. It was then followed by “Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men – New York and California” in July of the same year. However, in these early reports, the focus is on the strange illnesses these young gay men were succumbing to, as AIDS itself was unknown at the time. The only thing doctors did understand was that the immune systems of these men were almost nonexistent. Diseases like Kaposi’s Sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis were therefore considered opportunistic infections that were the cause of death but not the underlying issue behind these men’s health problems. It was not until the mid-1980s that the HIV virus was identified as the cause of AIDS.4",

    "text": "How did the queer community react to it in the early days?\nIn the early days of the AIDS epidemic, the queer community was divided in its reaction. For those already infected or who knew of other infected friends and lovers, the early period from 1980 until 1983 or so was one of great fear and loss but also one of activism and action to create support networks, hotlines, research funds, and safe sex education that would hopefully slow down transmission. These early activists in New York City include names like Larry Kramer, a gay playwright who founded the GMHC (Gay Mens Health Crisis) and ACT UP during AIDS, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, who were some of the earliest pioneers of gay safer sex education along with Callen being the face of PWA (People With AIDS) and founding his self-help group called PWAS, and other early GMHC members like Paul Popham who was their first President.\nHowever, in these early years, the vast majority of the gay population of New York City was a mix of unaware or in denial about the seriousness of AIDS due to mixed press coverage, lack of government intervention, and the feeling of gay liberation and being young and invisible. These men took longer to convince that AIDS was a big deal. Still, through organizations like GMHC, by 1983/84, more gay men were aware of the epidemic. Most men began to know people who died, which also increased awareness and fear. The community during this period generally came together and worked to support those with AIDS while also trying to keep people safe without knowing how the virus spread.",

    "text": "How did scientists react to it in the early days?\nScientists at the CDC and doctors who served large gay populations in NYC and California were called into action very early on during the AIDS epidemic. The CDC was there from day one of the MMRW report, and doctors like (insert guy from San Fran) and Joseph Sonnabend were some of the first to report cases and attempt treatment for opportunistic infections. In the first few years, the CDC spent its time doing epidemiology research to track and determine possible causes for the virus and researching causes and potential treatments in labs. Their early theories are listed below, but because their focus was on gay men and when they interviewed these men and found out that they were all highly sexually active and also did drugs, most of the early theories focused on drug use and “promiscuity.” Their interviewing, while at times misleading, did lead CDC scientists to hypothesize that the disease was spread through sexual contact and, more specifically, through bodily fluids like blood. Doctors in the early period attempted treatment and accepted patients in high numbers; however, as cases continued to rise and AIDS was connected to gay men, some hospitals stopped accepting patients with AIDS symptoms, which led to increased discrimination and medical issues for PWA.\nAt the same time, the stigma AIDS gained made some scientists wary of working on the disease and made the government reluctant to provide funding to the CDC, NIH, and other hospitals and scientists for research. These setbacks frustrated scientists at the CDC, such as Don Frances and Robert Gallo at the NIH, because they delayed crucial progress when the government had previously thrown money into research about toxic shock syndrome and Legionary disease quickly. After all, those diseases were not associated with a minority group that had significant stigma attached to it during a conservative time in American history. However, by the end of 1983, Robert Gallo had identified HIV as the cause of AIDS. By 1984/5, the public was also aware of this development.",

    "text": "How did the government react to it in the early days?\nThe best way to describe government reactions to the early AIDS crisis is that there was really no major reaction. The government became aware of AIDS in 1981. However, Ronald Reagan had just taken office, and the government itself was leaning far more conservative in the years leading up to AIDS with the rise of the Moral Majority to power and the failures of Jimmy Carter at the end of the 70s. Gay rights and protections of homosexuals were far down on the list of priorities for Reagan and his staff when AIDS hit the news. The government provided some money and resources to the CDC and other researchers, but it was limited.\nThe President and his staff offered no public statements on the epidemic until the late 1980s, leaving many AIDS patients and their friends and family feeling neglected by the government. Local AIDS organizations were founded to fill the needs of the people that the government was ignoring. Still, these organizations were often overwhelmed by the needs of PWA during the early years. The government also released no advice about prevention or treatment outside of CDC publications, which caused mass confusion and ignorance in the years that it mattered most, even though a few gay men put out their advice about AIDS prevention and public health actions, such as the need to close bathhouses, most people were skeptical about making changes without scientific and governmental proof. Surgeon General Everett Koop did not release advice on AIDS to the general public until 1988, when he pushed for the publication of the pamphlet “Understanding AIDS,” which caused him a significant backlash within the Republican Party.",

    "section": "What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?",
    "text": "What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?\nPoppers: The CDC, in the early days of their investigation in 1981, proposed the theory that poppers might be linked to AIDS. This conclusion was made because all of the first reported cases that they saw as linked were gay men who, upon their interviews, admitted to “sexual promiscuity” along with taking party drugs and sex aids like poppers. Poppers are inhaled and are known to relax muscles and create a short-lived high for users. They mess with the bloodstream and veins, so the CDC thought prolonged use might cause KS to develop, which was a common symptom in early patients. This theory remained in circulation until 1983 (but 84 for the general public), when it was determined that AIDS was caused by the HIV virus. However, some people still attribute poppers to KS and AIDS.\n\n\n\nA popper ad from Ciao! magazine in 1978 found in Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender collection. Manuscripts and Archives Division. The New York Public Library. Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations.\n\n\nPromiscuity: This early theory is linked to the theory for poppers. The CDC, in the early days, thought that “sexual promiscuity” along with poppers might be the cause of AIDS because so many of the early men they interviewed stated that they had sex with hundreds to thousands of men during their lifetime. This theory is also linked to the multi-causal theory that remained prominent for the first few years of AIDS before it was determined to be a virus. However, high amounts of sexual contact are the primary way the virus is spread, but it is not the cause of HIV.\nBlood/Bodily Fluids/Virus: As early as the beginning of 1982, the CDC had a working theory that the disease was a virus transferred via blood and/or bodily fluids because they began witnessing cases of blood transfusion recipients contracting the disease along with babies and hemophiliacs. However, they only had circumstantial evidence that this hypothesis was correct. So they were stuck in limbo with this solid working theory until someone could find the viral agent and prove it causes the same symptoms as the disease. Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier were working in their separate labs to find the virus and were successful in 1983/84. There is some contention about who discovered it first. Still, they were ultimately determined to be co-discoverers of the virus. By 1984/5, the public was aware that HIV caused the disease, therefore making it a viral illness that could potentially be treated with medicine that was then under development.\nMulti-causal through various STIs: This theory was very popular from around 1982 until 1984 or so. The idea was that because gay men were having so many sexual partners and experiences and also contracting multiple STIs over and over again, eventually, these infections all damaged the immune system of the person, which then caused the immunodeficiency that we now know as HIV/AIDS. The theory was pushed by Dr. Joseph Sonnabend and his two patients, Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen, in their safer sex pamphlet “How to Have Sex in an Epidemic” because, to them, it made more sense to get this illness after multiple sexual encounters over a long period rather than it only taking one sexual encounter to catch a virus. While they were proven wrong in 1985 with the discovery of the HIV virus, Callen and others remained skeptical that HIV was the true cause of their plight and continued to push for and believe in the multi-causal theory claiming that the virus theory had too many holes and was not backed by enough evidence.\nDrugs: Similar to the poppers theory, there was a connection early on between party drugs, street drugs, and HIV/AIDS due to the groups who got the disease in 1981: gay men and IV drug users. There was a belief that maybe some drug did something to the immune system or that a batch of drugs was tainted, which caused this mass string of illnesses. Like poppers, this line of inquiry remained in public discourse for years, but it lost credibility in scientific circles when no tainted drugs were found, and other evidence, like babies and blood transfusion recipients also contracting HIV/AIDS, emerged.",

    "text": "How do public sex establishments fit into the picture?\nThe use of these spaces (Bathhouses, sex clubs, backroom bars, etc.) became a debate about public health and personal freedoms that was at its height from 1982/3 until 1985/6. However, the discussion continued into the 1990s. Since the earliest days of the queer community in cities, gay men had found safety and each other in nightlife spaces; by the end of WWII, spaces were created that were gay-only bars and bathhouses for the first time, increasing the feelings of safety within the spaces. Although the spaces were often raided and closed and people arrested, there was a feeling of safety in numbers, and bathhouses, starting around the 1950s, were finally a place where men could have sex with other men without having to risk public sex like cruising or have to bring them home which many men could not do. By the 1970s and gay liberation, this history of gay bars and bathhouses was ingrained in the community, and these places were viewed both as sexual havens and as a core part of the gay experience and history. However, the opening of the proverbial closet in the 1970s due to Stonewall and consumer marketing towards gay men led to a mass influx of new establishments created for sexual encounters along with the traditional bars. While innovative, many of these locations were dirty and poorly run, and by the 1980s, men could have dozens of sexual encounters in one night due to mass gay migrations to cities and the ease of access to other willing men in bathhouses and backrooms. When AIDS emerges, these places are hot spots for the spread of the disease due to the unsafe nature of the encounters and the number of men who use them.",

    "text": "Closing public sex establishments as a Public Health measure defended:\nThe arguments for the closure of public sex establishments, specifically bathhouses, began in full by 1982, with the disease running rampant in California and New York. In 1982, Don Frances and other scientists from the CDC pushed the hypothesis that AIDS was spread through sexual contact, most likely via bodily fluids. Scientists like Selma Dritz began advocating for the closure of bathhouses to newspapers and gay men because the baths were “biological cesspools for infection,” but her early calls fell on deaf ears.5 Other officials also made calls for bathhouse closure in California and New York, like Ruth Silver, who stated, “If you’re saying that this can be spread through sexual contact, it makes sense to me to have the public health department get a court order to shut down the gay bathhouses. That would probably save lives.”6 Her words, like those of Dritz, were rejected and ignored. Months later, other politically active San Francisco gay men like Bill Kraus, Clive Jones, and Ron Huberman took it upon themselves to write a piece for publication that aimed to be a wake-up call to the community to join together to fight the disease while also protecting themselves by shutting down the baths or adopting safer sexual habits. In New York City, the gay community was not quite as politically active as in San Francisco. However, they, too, were fighting within themselves for bathhouse closure. The earliest safer sex calls came from Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen in New York, with their first article coming out in the fall of 1982 titled “We Know Who We Are.” The article was a call to gay men to stop unsafe sex and bathhouse use, and they received intense backlash.7 Their second attempt was a pamphlet in 1983 that taught men how to use safer sex techniques and broke down what was safe and what was risky, including warning men about bathhouses. Larry Kramer, another prominent figure in New York queer circles, was highly vocal about the need to close bathhouses and limit sexual contact as a way to save lives. Later in the debates, Callen and Kramer became leading voices in New York as they pushed to make gay men see the risks of baths remaining open and unchanging in their health standards. Their goal was to protect the community and to get the community to seek closure, which would pressure the government to shut down the baths.",

    "text": "Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:\nThe personal freedoms/civil liberties argument was also presented around 1982 when scientists and government officials started looking at the potential closure of bathhouses. These early opinions that closure would be a violation of gay men’s civil liberties were expressed by gay men as well as government officials and bathhouse owners. In 1982, all parties who argued bathhouses should remain open defended them because, at the time, the cause of the disease was still unknown. The CDC and other scientists’ closure recommendations were based only on a theory with little concrete proof. Therefore, public health officials and the mayors of New York City and San Francisco were unwilling to close the baths due to a lack of evidence and the amount of protest coming from gay men. Even the GMHC in the early period refused to make a definitive statement about bathhouses and sexual habits to callers on their hotline, instead opting to provide information but not make polarizing statements because they thought gay men got enough judgment from outside the community. The average bathhouse-attending gay men in the early period rejected the idea of closing the baths because they believed they had a right to access these historically significant gay spaces. There was little proof that AIDS was caused by sex.\nOnce it was determined that HIV/AIDS was indeed spread by bodily fluids, often through sex, the advocates for keeping spaces open shifted their arguments to focus on re-purposing the spaces and the safety the spaces offer gay men. These advocates offered forms of compromise, including using the spaces for educational purposes to keep men safe and allow them to continue their lifestyles; however, while in favor theoretically, bathhouse owners often failed to make these changes because it would affect their profit margins. The other main argument made for the personal freedom side is that these spaces provide a safe location to regulate sexual encounters that would otherwise happen elsewhere (the street, parks, or sex parties at people’s houses). This is in line with the historic intervention that bathhouses provided in gay communities because they were created and used as locations to move sexual encounters off the street to protect gay men from risky situations with the law. However, this argument was refuted by the other side that said no other location would offer the same conditions and number of men the way sex establishments did, so through closure, it would still reduce encounters by a significant amount. Despite these counterarguments, the personal freedoms side remained strong well into the 1990s, and they raised interesting points about the limits between personal choice and risk, community values and protections, and public health that are still issues today.8",

    "text": "Were there options to re-purpose public sex establishments within the queer community?\nThe short answer is yes; there were options proposed within the queer community to re-purpose public sex establishments like bathhouses and backroom bars during the height of the AIDS epidemic. One option that was talked about mainly by the pro-public sex side of the debate was the option for increased regulation of these spaces, ranging from workers who would keep an eye on sexual activity and remove those who were being unsafe to turning more lights on so people could see if they were with someone with KS lesions. The other option that was offered and attempted was to use these sex locations as educational opportunities to teach gay men safer sex techniques.\nThe debates about closing bathhouses in New York City ended for a short time through the compromise created by the GMHC that proposed that bathhouses could operate with their support if they adopted safer sex practices and encouraged education and safety in their establishments starting in 1983/4. Many of the bathhouses agreed to this system, which combined elements of both restriction and education. Michael Callen, once a frequent visitor to the baths, was tasked with conducting inspections of these establishments and grading them on their compliance. What you see below are photos of one of his inspection reports. The report shows that while there was some improvement in these locations displaying safer sex posters, offering condoms, turning on lights, and cleaning, the majority of places were not holding up their end of the bargain because it was costing them customers. It is not for lack of trying that the bathhouses and backrooms were ultimately closed in 1985 in NYC as there were multiple attempts to have them regulated and made into safer spaces where sex could be had in safer but still erotic ways in places dedicated to homosexual safety.\n\n\n\nOne of Michael Callen’s inspection reports from the baths pages 1-4.

The attempts by GMHC to use them for educational purposes were successful sometimes, but sometimes they were a bust. It was not for lack of trying that the attempts at compromise to keep these historic gay spaces open failed; instead, it was because these business owners were unwilling to give up profits for philanthropic causes. Gay men who went to the establishments were unlikely to listen to safer sex advice posters unless they were already scared or curious, especially by 1985. Leading figures in gay activism fought to get these locations closed even when there were moments of compromise and potential success, with Michael Callen being one of the biggest proponents of closure. Due to intense pressure from both the scientific and queer communities, by 1985, there was enough evidence for the mayor of New York to officially shut down the baths.",

    "text": "How does it connect to LGBTQ discrimination in New York City/within the US?\nCabaret licenses were created in the 1920s during Prohibition in New York City to restrict racial intermixing via dancing and other “inappropriate” social dancing behaviors within unlicensed businesses. Like with liquor licenses, places without a valid cabaret license, if caught allowing people, especially mixed race or same-sex couples, to dance or play live music while also selling food, would be at risk of closure. Equally, locations with licenses would be at risk of losing them if caught allowing “undesirable” behaviors within their establishments. In the later 1900s, after the legalization of interracial marriage and relationships, cabaret licenses became more of a way to restrict LGBT businesses from remaining open or allowing physical touch within their grounds. By the 1990s, the use of these licenses in the city against LGBT people and spaces was at its peak through rezoning efforts and reclassification of areas as non-cabaret zones. This law allowed gay people to use spaces. Still, it restricted their use of their bodies within the space because there were cases where even touching when music was playing was considered to violate the restrictions.",

Others decided to allow patrons to dance or play music or both and blacked out the windows or did other things to hide the inside of the establishment from onlookers while also often using code words to warn patrons when police were entering or planning to stop by to protect both the patrons and the business from punishment. Lastly, some businesses and people, especially towards the 1990s and into the 2000s, began to increasingly voice their protests about the use of the license as a form of discrimination and unlawful regulation of people’s culture and sexuality. These protests included writing pamphlets, protesting legislation, directly violating the law, and creating organizations based around ending this discrimination, such as the DANCE PARADE · DANCE LIBERATION NETWORK · People’s CULTURAL PLAN HOUSE COALITION · THE FLOASIS · COLOR OF CHANGE · LEGALIZE DANCE · DANCE NYC. The police enforced the cabaret licensing restrictions, often banning musicians from playing at certain establishments or closing venues due to non-compliance.\n\n\n\nimage for the NYC Dance organization’s protest.

    "text": "Is this type of regulation still around today?\nThis type of regulation is no longer in use within New York City. In 2017, the city repealed the Cabaret Licensing Law that had been enacted under Prohibition, so now there is no need for establishments to obtain a cabaret permit to have live music or dancing while also selling drinks. The license in modern times was seen as a hassle for businesses to go through rather than a potentially discriminatory regulation on queer and “rowdy” establishments the way it was during the 1920s until the late 1900s. It is interesting to note that this regulation was repealed after the 2012 legalization of gay marriage at a federal level, and it likely influenced the end of cabaret licensing in the city.",
