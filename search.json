Due to the underground, secretive, and crime-entangled nature of the Mafia their ownership allowed gay bars to operate in relative secret within the city, however their treatment of patrons and often strict rules led to feelings of resentment from within the queer community as the 1960s drew to a close.\n\nAn example/story about the use of this type of regulation quoted from George Chauncey or from a newspaper article\n\nNeed to find this\n\nLook into Snake Pit Bar raid for a good story",

    "text": "This webpage serves as the second part of my MA portfolio project. In its current form it is a beginning of what the final project should be. This is a website that will trace the history of queer spatial geography in New York City from the 1970s until 1986. I am interested in analyzing the locations of what Fiona Buckland called “third spaces” for queer people, especially gay bars, clubs, bathhouses, bookstores, cinemas, restaurants, sex stores, backrooms, and cruising locations.\nThe map and the companion text-based pages are an extension of my paper’s argument that safer sex education during AIDS was negotiated, contested, and implemented in public queer spaces by queer actors. It further visually supports and provides context for the acts of discrimination and general public health debates that impacted queer communities and establishments before and during AIDS. It visually argues that the government was both slow to shut down bathhouses and backrooms during AIDS and that it continued to use tactics of licensing and rezoning to discriminate against the queer community before, during, and after the peak of AIDS.\nIn its final form the website will trace the openings, closings, and relocating or negotiations occurring within the city at the time to show the attempts by the dominant society to limit queer spaces, representation, and culture. It does this via mapping and adding descriptions of the establishments. Currently the map is static with only a few locations listed but hopefully in the future there will be an interactive feature to the map that will link pages about each location to the main map.\nThis project took influence and hopes to contibute to the ongoing mapping efforts by other sites like https://www.queermaps.org/about and https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/theme/bars-nightlife/",

During the AIDS epidemic the New St. Marks Baths stayed open until 1985 when the city ordered every bathhouse to be closed. In that time the bath worked to provide sex education materials and condoms while still providing a safe space for men to have their sexual relations outside their homes."

This conclusion was made because all of the first reported cases that they saw as linked were gay men who upon their interviews admitted to “sexual promiscuity” along with taking party drugs and sex aids like poppers. Poppers are inhaled and are known to relax muscles and to create a short lived high for users. They mess with the blood stream and veins so the CDC thought prolonged use might cause KS to develop, which was a common symptom in early patients. This theory remained in circulation until 1985 when it was determined that AIDS was caused by the HIV virus. However, some people still attribute poppers to KS and AIDS.

    "text": "Kylie Edington:\nI am currently a Graduate Student at Virginia Tech ’25. I am in my first year of the History MA program, and my main research area is within the gender and sexuality framework. I am interested in queer history, histories of gender and sexuality, and the concepts of enjoyment and pleasure. I want to learn and explore new groups and find the moments of everyday pleasure in their lives to highlight the fun, freedoms, and opportunities people had in the past. Therefore, my current MA research projects both center on queer people in urban New York in the late 1900s, where they went to socialize and seek pleasure, and how they fought to find new ways to pursue sexual pleasure during the AIDS crisis.",

Some of the establishments were open before 1970 and many of them close after 1999 however these are the bounding years of my study so far. Below the map are detailed explanations of each location’s history. Enjoy!"

    "text": "Is this type of regulation still around today?\nThis type of regulation is no longer in use within New York City. In 2017 the city repealed the Cabaret Licensing Law that had been enacted under Prohibition, so now there is no need for establishments to go through the process of obtaining a cabaret permit in order to have live music or dancing while also selling drinks. The license in modern times was seen as a hassle for businesses to go through rather than a potentially discriminatory regulation on queer and “rowdy” establishments the way it was during the 1920s until the late 1900s.",
