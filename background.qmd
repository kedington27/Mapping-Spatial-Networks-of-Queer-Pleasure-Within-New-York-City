## Before Stonewall: A Brief Recounting of American Queer History

It is important to mention and always remember that queer history within
the United States did not start with Stonewall, nor did queer political
history start with the Stonewall riots in 1969. Many past historians
have worked tirelessly to reveal queer history within the United States.
The first queer history scholars presented research to help the early
history of LGBT communities and political activism come to light (though
there are many other newer scholars who add to their narratives and
include new locations, groups, and time periods since the field is still
relatively new and there are always new angles and communities that
deserve historical analysis!).

Chauncey, an early scholar, focuses on the 1890s to 1940s in New York
City and he worked to document a proto-queer community in primarily the
middle to working class. During this early period of queer history
labels that we know today such as gay, lesbian, and homosexual were not
commonly used or were used as derogatory slang/a medical diagnosis.
Identity (both sexual and gender-based) in this period as identified by
scholars was much more flexible than many people imagine it to be today.
Many men who frequented nightlife areas of New York City and sought out
the company of other men often did not classify themselves as being
attracted only to men.[^1] These men were considered to be "wolves" or
"trade" as they typically were married and appeared as strong and manly
men who sought out more feminine men called "fairies" to perform sexual
acts with in clubs and on the streets of the city at night.[^2] These
men were still seen as dominant by society at large because they took
the masculine role during sex, meaning they were the penetrator.
Meanwhile, the fairies were viewed as feminine in the eyes of the
general working class public because they were the ones being penetrated
much like a woman. Some fairies even dressed in drag and therefore
presented as women during their time on the streets. Only after WWII did
the enforcement of a firmer binary based on sex enter into the middle
and working class consciousness due to the increasing medicalization of
sexuality and the increased focus on sexual deviancy by the government
and society as a whole.[^3] Since the beginning of Prohibition and even
more so with the medicalization of homosexuality in the post war period
gay and non-heterosexual identities began to retreat from the public
eye. Laws and regulatory vice squads increased fear and risk of engaging
in homosexual activity or inviting homosexual clientele into public
establishments, especially nightlife locations such as bars, cabarets,
and late night restaurants where these men typically would meet to
socialize. Scholars therefore determine that the closet that in modern
culture is a very common concept was created during the transition after
WWII to a more binary and medicalized idea of sexuality and
identity.[^4] These outside factors hid the queer community from outside
eyes up until Stonewall because the community that was once very
prominent in New York City was forced underground starting in the 1920s
until the 1960s.

Other scholars focus on areas outside of New York City and on more
recent periods where the closet existed and the government and medical
science was creating the modern construction of queer identity. The
important part of their research is that political activism within the
queer community had roots in the 1950s through the creation of the
Mattachine Society first in California and then in various cities across
the United States including Washington D.C. The reason that this
organization is not well known is because the membership was always
quite small and their mission was not as radical as the goals of later
queer activism in the 1970s and onward.[^5] The goal of the society was
to advocate for gay rights and to work to assimilate into heterosexual
society in the hopes of being viewed as respectable and deserving of
equal rights.[^6] The group started in California under the leadership
of Harry Hay who based the structure of the organization off of the
structure of Communist organizations. By the late 1950s the organization
had spread to the East Coast (the West Coast queer community was always
more politically active at least up until AIDS in the 1980s and 90s) and
Frank Kameny started the D.C. branch of the group during the fight
against government discrimination of sexuality of its federal
employees.[^7] It was this branch that conducted the first protest of
gay rights and equality on the White House in 1965 and while it was a
small protest that had little immediate impact it was a milestone of
visibility for the community and for the start of a more militant
political advocacy moving into the 1960s.

The key takeaway from these two discussions of early history is that
Stonewall was not the start of queer history or political advocacy but
rather a continuation of a longer history and the start of a new chapter
of queerness in America through new tactics and new struggles. The
importance of Stonewall itself is that it pushed the homosexual
underground back into the public eye and was a large scale rejection of
discrimination on behalf of a whole community. Stonewall opened the door
to a new way to be openly gay or queer on a large scale that had been
forgotten about since WWII.

## Stonewall 1969

The Stonewall Riots occurred from June 28th until July 3rd 1969 in and
around the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a
popular gay bar that had been in operation since 1967 but if had been a
popular restaurant under the same name as early as the 1930s. Due to the
ban on liquor licenses for establishments that served homosexuals by the
State Liquor Authority the Stonewall Inn was operated by the mafia from
1967 up to the police raid and subsequent riots on the 28th of June.
This was not the first time that Stonewall had been raided by the police
but normally there was notice because the mafia often paid the police to
provide a warning. However tensions had been brewing between the mafia
owners and the queer clientele and between the police and both other
parties. Gay men and other queer folk who went to the Stonewall Inn grew
sick of following the strict guidelines set by the mafia owners that
were enforced to protect the owners from losing their business because
they were very restrictive. Meanwhile the police were trying to comply
with anti-homosexual legislation and also were less and less influenced
by the mafia as a whole which put mafia owned gay bars at risk as the
1960s moved forward. Below I am quoting a newspaper report on the
initial night of the riots that was published in July of 1969 to provide
an eye witness narrative of the event. It is important to highlight that
gay men, gender nonconforming individuals, and transgender women were
all vital participants in the Stonewall Riots and all of these groups
used the Inn as a social safe space that was violated by the police. The
events of the riots were a long time coming from decades of
discrimination and mistreatment by mafia owners, police, and the
government that built up into resentment and finally into political
action.

#### Quoted: Full Moon Over the Stonewall: Howard Smith’s Account of the Stonewall Riots

*During the “gay power” riots at the Stonewall last Friday night I found
myself on what seemed to me the wrong side of the blue line. Very scary.
Very enlightening.*

*I had struck up a spontaneous relationship with Deputy Inspector Pine,
who had marshalled the raid, and was following him closely, listening to
all the little dialogues and plans and police inflections. Things were
already pretty tense: the gay customers freshly ejected from their
hangout, prancing high and jubilant in the street, had been joined by
quantities of Friday night tourists hawking around for Village-type
excitement. The cops had considerable trouble arresting the few people
they wanted to take in for further questioning. A strange mood was in
the crowd — I noticed the full moon. Loud defiances mixed with skittish
hilarity made for a more dangerous stage of protest; they were feeling
their impunity. This kind of crowd freaks easily.*

*The turning point came when the police had difficulty keeping a dyke in
a patrol car. Three times she slid out and tried to walk away. The last
time a cop bodily heaved her in. The crowd shrieked, “Police brutality!”
“Pigs!” A few coins sailed through the air. I covered my face. Pine
ordered the three cars and paddy wagon to leave with the prisoners
before the crowd became more of a mob. “Hurry back,” he added, realizing
he and his force of eight detectives, two of them women, would be easily
overwhelmed if the temper broker. “Just drop them at the Sixth Precinct
and hurry back.”*

*The sirened caravan pushed through the gauntlet, pummeled and buffeted
until it managed to escape. “Pigs!” “Gaggot cops!” Pennies and dimes
flew. I stood against the door. The detectives held at most a 10-foot
clearing. Escalate to nickels and quarters. A bottle. Another bottle.
Pine says, “Let’s get inside. Lock ourselves inside, it’s safer.”*

*“You want to come in?” he asks me. “You’re probably safer,” with a
paternal tone. Two flashes: if they go in and I stay out, will the mob
know that the blue plastic thing hanging from my shirt is a press card,
or by now will they assume I’m a cop too? On the other hand, it might be
interesting to be locked in with a few cops, just rapping and reviewing
how they work.*

*In goes me. We bolt the heavy door. The front of the Stonewall is
mostly brick except for the windows, which are boarded within by
plywood. Inside we hear the shattering of windows, followed by what we
imagine to be bricks pounding on the door, voices yelling. The floor
shudders at each blow. “Aren’t you guys scared?” I say.*

*“No.” But they look at least uneasy.*

*The door crashes open, beer cans and bottles hurl in. Pine and his
troop rush to shut it. At that point the only uniformed cop among them
gets hit with something under his eye. He hollers, and his hand comes
away scarlet. It looks a lot more serious than it really is. They are
all suddenly furious. Three run out in front to see if they can scare
the mob from the door. A hail of coins. A beer can glances off Deputy
Inspector Smyth’s head.*

*Pine, a man of about 40 and smallish build, gathers himself, leaps out
into the melee, and grabs someone around the waist, pulling him downward
and back into the doorway. They fall. Pine regains hold and drags the
elected protester inside by the hair. The door slams again. Angry cops
converge on the guy, releasing their anger on this sample from the mob.
Pine is saying, “I saw him throwing somethin,” and the guy unfortunately
is giving some sass, snidely admits to throwing “only a few coins.” The
cop who was cut is incensed, yells something like, “So you’re the one
who hit me!” And while the other cops help, he slaps the prisoner five
or six times very hard and finishes with a punch to the mouth. They
handcuff the guy as he almost passes out. “All right,” Pine announces,
“we book him for assault.” The door is smashed open again. More objects
are thrown in. The detectives locate a fire hose, the idea being to ward
off the madding crowd until reinforcements arrive. They can’t see where
to aim it, wedging the hose in a crack in the door. It sends out a weak
stream. We all start to slip on water and Pine says to stop.*

*By now the mind’s eye has forgotten the character of the mob; the sound
filtering in doesn’t suggest dancing faggots any more. It sounds like a
powerful rage bent on vendetta. That way why Pine’s singling out the guy
I knew later to be Dan Van Ronk was important. The little force of
detectives was beginning to feel fear, and Pine’s action clinched their
morale again.*

*A door over to the side almost gives. One cop shouts, “Get away from
there or I’ll shoot!” It stops shaking. The front door is completely
open. One of the big plywood windows gives, and it seems inevitable that
the mob will pour in. A kind of tribal adrenaline rush bolsters all of
us; they all take out and check pistols. I see both policewomen busy
doing the same, and the danger becomes even more real. I find a big
wrench behind the bar, jam it into my belt like a scimitar. Hindsight:
my fear on the verge of being trampled by a mob fills the same dimension
as my fear on the verge of being clubbed by the TPF.*

*Pine places a few men on each side of the corridor leading away from
the entrance. They aim unwavering at the door. One detective arms
himself in addition with a sawed-off baseball bat he has found. I hear,
“We’ll shoot the first motherfucker that comes through the door.”*

*Pine glances over toward me. “Are you all right, Howard?” I can’t
believe what I’m saying: “I’d feel a lot better with a gun.”*

*I can only see the arm at the window. It squirts a liquid into the
room, and a flaring match follows. Pine is not more than 10 feet away.
He aims his gun at the figures.*

*He doesn’t fire. The sound of sirens coincides with the whoosh of
flames where the lighter fluid was thrown. Later, Pine tells me he
didn’t shoot because he had heard the sirens in time and felt no need to
kill someone if help was arriving. That was close.*

*While the squads of uniforms disperse the mob out front, inside we are
checking to see if each of us all right. For a few minutes we get the
post-tension giggles, but as they subside I start scribbling notes to
catch up, and the people around me change back to cops. They begin
examining the place.*

*It had lasted 45 minutes. Just before and after the siege I picked up
some more detached information. According to the police, they are not
picking on homosexuals. On these raids they almost never arrest
customers, only people working there. As of June 1, the State Liquor
Authority said that all unlicensed places were eligible to apply for
licenses. The police are scrutinizing all unlicensed places, and most of
the bars that are in that category happen to cater to homosexuals. The
Stonewall is an unlicensed private club. The raid was made with a
warrant, after undercover agents inside observed illegal sale of
alcohol. To make certain the raid plans did not leak, it was made
without notifying the Sixth Precinct until after the detectives (all
from the First Division) were inside the premises. Once the bust had
actually started, one of Pine’s men called the Sixth for assistance on a
pay phone.*

*It was explained to me that generally men dressed as men, even if
wearing extensive makeup, are always released; men dressed as women are
sometimes arrested; and “men” fully dressed as women, but who upon
inspection by a policewoman prove to have undergone the sex-change
operations, are always let go. At the Stonewall, out of the five queens
checked, three were men and two were changes, even though all said they
were girls. Pine released them all anyway.*

*As for the rough-talking owners and/or managers of the Stonewall, their
riff ran something like this: we are just honest businessmen who are
being harassed by the police because we cater to homosexuals, and
because our names are Italian so they think we are part of something
bigger. We haven’t done anything wrong and have never been convicted in
no court. We have rights, and the courts should decide and not let the
police do things like what happened here. When we got back in the place,
all the mirrors, jukeboxes, phones, toilets, and cigarette machines were
smashed. Even the sinks were stuffed and running over. And we say the
police did it. The courts will say that we are innocent.*

*Who isn’t, I thought, as I dropped my scimitar and departed.*[^8]

## 1970s = Welcome to Gay Liberation

After the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and the national impact the riots had
on queer communities, there was a push for increased political action by
many members of the queer community. In the direct aftermath of the
Stonewall riots in New York Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco's
queer communities had similar riots, parades, protests, and
demonstrations in comradery with the New York queer community.[^9] The
original riots inspired the creation of more political organizations
nationally within the queer community that were more public and
aggressive than their Mattachine Society predecessor like the Gay
Liberation Front and Gay Activist Alliance. The 1970s were dominated by
the Gay Liberation Movement that focused on pushing for equal rights for
all sexualities (and often gender equality because many lesbians were
also heavily involved in the feminist movement), opening up the
community to remove a level of shame that the LGBTQ community felt, and
to express sexual freedom and to enjoy a lifestyle that would have been
impossible a generation prior. Various queer people interpreted this
period differently. Some dove head into political action and led the
charge of entering political lobbying and protesting. In contrast,
others focused more on the new nightlife and lifestyle opportunities in
large cities.[^10] Some people, of course, partook in both parts of the
gay liberation movement. Still, typically, the West Coast was more
interested in political action, and the East Coast was more into the
sexual and commercial liberation that came with the 1970s, but both
sides of liberation occurred nationally.

:::

The sexual and commercial side of liberation was revolutionary and only
possible because of the political advancement and the willingness of a
large portion of the queer community to "come out" and open up their
world to the public. During this time, there was a spike in queer
establishments in large cities like New York and San Francisco that were
no longer just based on socialization but on creating sexual encounters.
The increased use and creation of bathhouses, sex clubs, and backrooms
made nightlife in cities an unlimited sexual buffet of various men in
various settings that had gay men migrating into cities and also
vacationing to other cities across the United States and globally. This
freedom to have sex and also to have public spaces only for them was
thought to be well deserved after decades of shame, fear, guilt, and
isolation, and many younger gay men flocked to cities to experience this
new era of openness and sexual exploration. Nightlife boomed, and a new
culture of appealing to gay men through sex via advertisements, consumer
goods, and establishments was born. During the 1970s, within this sex
liberation culture, there was very little thought about the consequences
of the amount of unprotected sex that occurred and sex-based
establishments that operated in large cities like New York, which became
necessary for the transition into the 1980s and the spread of HIV/AIDS.

## The 1980s: AIDS and Impact of the Liberation Spirit

The 1980s were both a continuation of the liberation spirit of the 1970s
and a shift into another new era of queer history: the AIDS period.
HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1981 in the United States. However, the
spread most likely occurred during the 1970s through the increase in
sexual partners and establishments that offered space for anonymous
unprotected sexual encounters in cities like New York and San Francisco.
Doctors during the 1970s and into the 1980s reported increasing numbers
of gay men coming to them with STIs (sexually transmitted infections)
multiple times. The reason for the large amounts of STIs and the
repeated infections stemmed from both the number of partners men had sex
with and that the sex was almost always unprotected (without condoms)
because gay men saw condoms as unnecessary since they could not get
pregnant and STIs were curable with pills. Some gay doctors like Dr.
Joseph Sonnabend in New York worried that the number of infections would
damage gay men's immune systems or that a new STI would develop that
would be more damaging and incurable during this period. Still, most gay
men did not listen to doctor advice due to a historical distrust of
medicine by the community.[^11] When HIV/AIDS first started appearing in
1981, these doctors had their worst fears realized. For many gay men as
the 1980s went on, it felt as though the 1970s was a utopia that had
been too good to be true, and new fears and restrictions bloomed in the
community. Gay liberation, while it may have helped to bring an increase
of the deadly epidemic to thousands of gay men, also provided gay men
(and other allies) the tools to combat it as a community, provide
education, and protest politically about the virus and the lack of
governmental assistance.

    72-79, 161-182.

As I mentioned in the 1970s section, there was a large migration of
queer men to cities which helped re-open the queer community to the
general public while also providing queer men access to a larger network
of friends that, in turn, formed a stronger community by the time AIDS
started appearing as a fatal illness for many gay men. While the
community had been joined through sexual encounters and fighting for
equality in the 1970s, in the 1980s, these early bonds changed to
becoming networks of support for AIDS patients and organizations for
advocacy, information, or political activism. Equally, the shift to
advertising and commercializing sex in the 1970s was re-purposed in the
1980s to help organizations and advocates like GMHC (Gay Mens Health
Crisis) and Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz educate gay men about
the risks of unprotected sex and the ways that safer sex could save
lives. GMHC focused on the concept of eroticizing safer sex through
using erotic videos and basing the designs of their safer sex brochures
on sex toy ads.

Callen and Berkowitz attempted to rally and warn the community through
their pamphlet and newspaper article using slang and erotic terminology
instead of medical terms when discussing sex, which GMHC later
incorporated the same technique in their own educational
programming.[^12]

The GMHC also, in the early period, sought to use public sex spaces like
bathhouses and backrooms as locations to teach gay men the benefits of
safer sex because they were spaces where sex occurred and, therefore,
could help with reaching large numbers of men and showing that using
condoms and other safer sex methods could still be considered desirable
within these locations. The idea was if the places were to continue to
exist, they should be places where gay men could make educated
decisions. If sex became safer and was still viewed as erotic enough to
keep baths in business, then AIDS would be reduced through educational
methods created by gay men themselves.

Finally, political groups like ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power)
in New York formed and developed tactics from those used by gay
liberation protests along with those from the feminist and civil rights
movements.[^13] Many of the members of ACT UP were not part of the
previous 1960s and 70s movements but those who were brought knowledge of
how to organize a group, how to get media attention, and most
importantly, how to present a clear message about what a group is
fighting to fix. ACT UP took elements from various movements and created
a successful campaign to fight for treatment options, medical trial
access, and reasonable costs for people with AIDS. While their protests
often verged on the line of respectable and offensive, and their
membership, like most large AIDS organizations, was predominantly gay
white men with money, it is undeniable that ACT UP, through their use of
gay liberation networks and techniques, made a significant impact on the
development of treatment for AIDS. Equally it is clear that GMHC made
significant strides in prevention education through the use of gay
liberation commercialization and eroticization of sex that saved lives
when treatment was not an option.
