## Before Stonewall: A Brief recounting of American Queer History

It is important to mention and always remember that queer history within
the United States did not start with Stonewall, nor did queer political
history start with the Stonewall riots in 1969. Many past historians
have worked tirelessly to reveal queer history within the United States.
The first queer history scholars presented research to help the early
history of LGBT communities and political activism come to light (though
there are many other newer scholars who add to their narratives and
include new locations, groups, and time periods since the field is still
relatively new and there are always new angles and communities that
deserve historical analysis!).

Chauncey, an early scholar, focuses on the 1890s to 1940s in New York
City and he worked to document a proto-queer community in primarily the
middle to working class. During this early period of queer history
labels that we know today such as gay, lesbian, and homosexual were not
commonly used or were used as derogatory slang/a medical diagnosis.
Identity (both sexual and gender-based) in this period as identified by
Chauncey was much more flexible than many people imagine it to be today.
Many men who frequented nightlife areas of New York City and sought out
the company of other men often did not classify themselves as being
attracted only to men. These men were considered to be "wolves" as they
typically were married and appeared as strong and manly men who sought
out more feminine men called "fairies" to perform sexual acts with in
clubs and on the streets of the city at night. These men were still seen
as dominant because they took the masculine role during sex, meaning
they were the penetrator and the fairies were viewed as feminine rather
than as another man in the eyes of the general working class public
because they were the ones being penetrated much like a woman would be
and some fairies even dressed in drag and therefore presented as women
during their time on the streets. Only after WWII did the enforcement of
a firmer binary based on sex enter into the middle and working class
consciousness due to the increasing medicalization of sexuality and the
increased focus on sexual deviancy by the government and society as a
whole. Since the beginning of Prohibition and even more so with the
medicalization of homosexuality in the post war period gay and
non-heterosexual identities began to retreat from the public eye. Laws
and regulatory vice squads increased fear and risk of engaging in
homosexual activity or inviting homosexual clientele into public
establishments, especially nightlife locations such as bars, cabarets,
and late night restaurants where these men typically would meet to
socialize. Chauncey therefore determines that the closet that in modern
culture is a very common concept was created during this time and these
outside factors hid the queer community from outside eyes up until
Stonewall because the community that was once very prominent in New York
City was forced underground starting in the 1920s until the 1960s.

D'Emilio and David Johnson both focus on areas outside of New York City
during the 1950s and 60s. The important part of their research is that
political activism within the queer community had roots in the 1950s
through the creation of the Mattachine Society first in California and
then in various cities across the United States including Washington
D.C. The reason that this organization is not well known is because the
membership was always quite small and their mission was not as radical
as the goals of later queer activism in the 1970s and onward. The goal
of the society was to advocate for gay rights and to work to assimilate
into heterosexual society in the hopes of being viewed as respectable
and deserving of equal rights. The group started in California under the
leadership of Harry Hay who based the structure of the organization off
of the structure of Communist organizations. By the late 1950s the
organization had spread to the East Coast (the West Coast queer
community was always more politically active at least up until AIDS in
the 1980s and 90s) and Frank Kameny started the D.C. branch of the group
during the fight against government discrimination of sexuality of its
federal employees. It was this branch that conducted the first protest
of gay rights and equality on the White House and while it was a small
protest that had little immediate impact it was a milestone of
visibility for the community and for the start of a more militant
political advocacy moving into the 1960s. The key takeaway from these
two discussions of early history is that Stonewall was not the start of
queer history or political advocacy but rather a continuation of a
longer history and the start of a new chapter of queerness in America
through new tactics and new struggles.

## Stonewall 1969

The Stonewall Riots occurred from June 28th until July 3rd 1969 in and
around the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a
popular gay bar that had been in operation since 1967 but if had been a
popular restaurant under the same name as early as the 1930s. Due to the
ban on liquor licenses for establishments that served homosexuals by the
State Liquor Authority the Stonewall Inn was operated by the mafia from
1967 up to the police raid and subsequent riots on the 28th of June.
This was not the first time that Stonewall had been raided by the police
but normally there was notice because the mafia often paid the police to
provide a warning. However tensions had been brewing between the mafia
owners and the queer clientele and between the police and both other
parties. Gay men and other queer folk who went to the Stonewall Inn grew
sick of following the strict guidelines set by the mafia owners that
were enforced to protect the owners from losing their business because
they were very restrictive. Meanwhile the police were trying to comply
with anti-homosexual legislation and also were less and less influenced
by the mafia as a whole which put mafia owned gay bars at risk as the
1960s moved forward. Below I am quoting a newspaper report on the
initial night of the riots that was published in July of 1969 to provide
an eye witness narrative of the event. I am choosing to do so because
this primary source account can convey better emotional impact and
detailed narrative outlines than me summarizing the event could present.
It is important to highlight that gay men, gender nonconforming
individuals, and transgender women were all vital participants in the
Stonewall Riots and all of these groups used the Inn as a social safe
space that was violated by the police. The events of the riots were a
long time coming from decades of discrimination and mistreatment by
mafia owners, police, and the government that built up into resentment
and finally into political action.

#### Quoted: Full Moon Over the Stonewall: Howard Smith’s Account of the Stonewall Riots

*During the “gay power” riots at the Stonewall last Friday night I found
myself on what seemed to me the wrong side of the blue line. Very scary.
Very enlightening.*

*I had struck up a spontaneous relationship with Deputy Inspector Pine,
who had marshalled the raid, and was following him closely, listening to
all the little dialogues and plans and police inflections. Things were
already pretty tense: the gay customers freshly ejected from their
hangout, prancing high and jubilant in the street, had been joined by
quantities of Friday night tourists hawking around for Village-type
excitement. The cops had considerable trouble arresting the few people
they wanted to take in for further questioning. A strange mood was in
the crowd — I noticed the full moon. Loud defiances mixed with skittish
hilarity made for a more dangerous stage of protest; they were feeling
their impunity. This kind of crowd freaks easily.*

*The turning point came when the police had difficulty keeping a dyke in
a patrol car. Three times she slid out and tried to walk away. The last
time a cop bodily heaved her in. The crowd shrieked, “Police brutality!”
“Pigs!” A few coins sailed through the air. I covered my face. Pine
ordered the three cars and paddy wagon to leave with the prisoners
before the crowd became more of a mob. “Hurry back,” he added, realizing
he and his force of eight detectives, two of them women, would be easily
overwhelmed if the temper broker. “Just drop them at the Sixth Precinct
and hurry back.”*

*The sirened caravan pushed through the gauntlet, pummeled and buffeted
until it managed to escape. “Pigs!” “Gaggot cops!” Pennies and dimes
flew. I stood against the door. The detectives held at most a 10-foot
clearing. Escalate to nickels and quarters. A bottle. Another bottle.
Pine says, “Let’s get inside. Lock ourselves inside, it’s safer.”*

*“You want to come in?” he asks me. “You’re probably safer,” with a
paternal tone. Two flashes: if they go in and I stay out, will the mob
know that the blue plastic thing hanging from my shirt is a press card,
or by now will they assume I’m a cop too? On the other hand, it might be
interesting to be locked in with a few cops, just rapping and reviewing
how they work.*

*In goes me. We bolt the heavy door. The front of the Stonewall is
mostly brick except for the windows, which are boarded within by
plywood. Inside we hear the shattering of windows, followed by what we
imagine to be bricks pounding on the door, voices yelling. The floor
shudders at each blow. “Aren’t you guys scared?” I say.*

*“No.” But they look at least uneasy.*

*The door crashes open, beer cans and bottles hurl in. Pine and his
troop rush to shut it. At that point the only uniformed cop among them
gets hit with something under his eye. He hollers, and his hand comes
away scarlet. It looks a lot more serious than it really is. They are
all suddenly furious. Three run out in front to see if they can scare
the mob from the door. A hail of coins. A beer can glances off Deputy
Inspector Smyth’s head.*

*Pine, a man of about 40 and smallish build, gathers himself, leaps out
into the melee, and grabs someone around the waist, pulling him downward
and back into the doorway. They fall. Pine regains hold and drags the
elected protester inside by the hair. The door slams again. Angry cops
converge on the guy, releasing their anger on this sample from the mob.
Pine is saying, “I saw him throwing somethin,” and the guy unfortunately
is giving some sass, snidely admits to throwing “only a few coins.” The
cop who was cut is incensed, yells something like, “So you’re the one
who hit me!” And while the other cops help, he slaps the prisoner five
or six times very hard and finishes with a punch to the mouth. They
handcuff the guy as he almost passes out. “All right,” Pine announces,
“we book him for assault.” The door is smashed open again. More objects
are thrown in. The detectives locate a fire hose, the idea being to ward
off the madding crowd until reinforcements arrive. They can’t see where
to aim it, wedging the hose in a crack in the door. It sends out a weak
stream. We all start to slip on water and Pine says to stop.*

*By now the mind’s eye has forgotten the character of the mob; the sound
filtering in doesn’t suggest dancing faggots any more. It sounds like a
powerful rage bent on vendetta. That way why Pine’s singling out the guy
I knew later to be Dan Van Ronk was important. The little force of
detectives was beginning to feel fear, and Pine’s action clinched their
morale again.*

*A door over to the side almost gives. One cop shouts, “Get away from
there or I’ll shoot!” It stops shaking. The front door is completely
open. One of the big plywood windows gives, and it seems inevitable that
the mob will pour in. A kind of tribal adrenaline rush bolsters all of
us; they all take out and check pistols. I see both policewomen busy
doing the same, and the danger becomes even more real. I find a big
wrench behind the bar, jam it into my belt like a scimitar. Hindsight:
my fear on the verge of being trampled by a mob fills the same dimension
as my fear on the verge of being clubbed by the TPF.*

*Pine places a few men on each side of the corridor leading away from
the entrance. They aim unwavering at the door. One detective arms
himself in addition with a sawed-off baseball bat he has found. I hear,
“We’ll shoot the first motherfucker that comes through the door.”*

*Pine glances over toward me. “Are you all right, Howard?” I can’t
believe what I’m saying: “I’d feel a lot better with a gun.”*

*I can only see the arm at the window. It squirts a liquid into the
room, and a flaring match follows. Pine is not more than 10 feet away.
He aims his gun at the figures.*

*He doesn’t fire. The sound of sirens coincides with the whoosh of
flames where the lighter fluid was thrown. Later, Pine tells me he
didn’t shoot because he had heard the sirens in time and felt no need to
kill someone if help was arriving. That was close.*

*While the squads of uniforms disperse the mob out front, inside we are
checking to see if each of us all right. For a few minutes we get the
post-tension giggles, but as they subside I start scribbling notes to
catch up, and the people around me change back to cops. They begin
examining the place.*

*It had lasted 45 minutes. Just before and after the siege I picked up
some more detached information. According to the police, they are not
picking on homosexuals. On these raids they almost never arrest
customers, only people working there. As of June 1, the State Liquor
Authority said that all unlicensed places were eligible to apply for
licenses. The police are scrutinizing all unlicensed places, and most of
the bars that are in that category happen to cater to homosexuals. The
Stonewall is an unlicensed private club. The raid was made with a
warrant, after undercover agents inside observed illegal sale of
alcohol. To make certain the raid plans did not leak, it was made
without notifying the Sixth Precinct until after the detectives (all
from the First Division) were inside the premises. Once the bust had
actually started, one of Pine’s men called the Sixth for assistance on a
pay phone.*

*It was explained to me that generally men dressed as men, even if
wearing extensive makeup, are always released; men dressed as women are
sometimes arrested; and “men” fully dressed as women, but who upon
inspection by a policewoman prove to have undergone the sex-change
operations, are always let go. At the Stonewall, out of the five queens
checked, three were men and two were changes, even though all said they
were girls. Pine released them all anyway.*

*As for the rough-talking owners and/or managers of the Stonewall, their
riff ran something like this: we are just honest businessmen who are
being harassed by the police because we cater to homosexuals, and
because our names are Italian so they think we are part of something
bigger. We haven’t done anything wrong and have never been convicted in
no court. We have rights, and the courts should decide and not let the
police do things like what happened here. When we got back in the place,
all the mirrors, jukeboxes, phones, toilets, and cigarette machines were
smashed. Even the sinks were stuffed and running over. And we say the
police did it. The courts will say that we are innocent.*

*Who isn’t, I thought, as I dropped my scimitar and departed.*[^1]

## 1970s = Welcome to Gay Liberation

After the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and the national impact the riots had
on queer communities, there was a push for increased political action by
all members of the queer community. The 1970s were dominated by the Gay
Liberation Movement that focused on pushing for equal rights for all
sexualities (and often gender equality because many lesbians were also
heavily involved in the feminist movement), opening up the community to
remove a level of shame that the LGBTQ community felt, and to express
sexual freedom and to enjoy a lifestyle that would have been impossible
a generation prior. Various queer people interpreted this period
differently. Some dove head into political action and led the charge of
entering political lobbying and protesting. In contrast, others focused
more on the new nightlife and lifestyle opportunities in large cities.
Some people, of course, partook in both parts of the gay liberation
movement. Still, typically, the West Coast was more interested in
political action, and the East Coast was more into the sexual and
commercial liberation that came with the 1970s, but both sides of
liberation occurred nationally.

The sexual and commercial side of liberation was revolutionary and only
possible because of the political advancement and the willingness of a
large portion of the queer community to "come out" and open up their
world to the public. During this time, there was a spike in queer
establishments in large cities like New York and San Francisco that were
no longer just based on socialization but on creating sexual encounters.
The increased use and creation of bathhouses, sex clubs, and backrooms
made nightlife in cities an unlimited sexual buffet of various men in
various settings that had gay men migrating into cities and also
vacationing to other cities across the United States and globally. This
freedom to have sex and also to have public spaces only for them was
thought to be well deserved after decades of shame, fear, guilt, and
isolation, and many younger gay men flocked to cities to experience this
new era of openness and sexual exploration. Nightlife boomed, and a new
culture of appealing to gay men through sex via advertisements, consumer
goods, and establishments was born. During the 1970s, within this sex
liberation culture, there was very little thought about the consequences
of the amount of unprotected sex that occurred and sex-based
establishments that operated in large cities like New York, which became
necessary for the transition into the 1980s and the spread of HIV/AIDS.

## The 1980s: AIDS and Impact of the Liberation Spirit

The 1980s were both a continuation of the liberation spirit of the 1970s
and a shift into another new era of queer history: the AIDS period.
HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1981 in the United States. However, the
spread most likely occurred during the 1970s through the increase in
sexual partners and establishments that offered space for anonymous
unprotected sexual encounters in cities like New York and San Francisco.
Doctors during the 1970s and into the 1980s reported increasing numbers
of gay men coming to them with STIs (sexually transmitted infections)
multiple times. The reason for the large amounts of STIs and the
repeated infections stemmed from both the number of partners men had sex
with and that the sex was almost always unprotected (without condoms)
because gay men saw condoms as unnecessary since they could not get
pregnant and STIs were curable with pills. Some gay doctors like Dr.
Joseph Sonnabend in New York worried that the number of infections would
damage gay men's immune systems or that a new STI would develop that
would be more damaging and incurable during this period. Still, most gay
men did not listen to doctor advice due to a historical distrust of
medicine by the community.[^2] When HIV/AIDS first started appearing in
1981, these doctors had their worst fears realized. For many gay men as
the 1980s went on, it felt as though the 1970s was a utopia that had
been too good to be true, and new fears and restrictions bloomed in the
community. Gay liberation, while it may have helped to bring an increase
of the deadly epidemic to thousands of gay men, also provided gay men
(and other allies) the tools to combat it as a community, provide
education, and protest politically about the virus and the lack of
governmental assistance.

As I mentioned in the 1970s section, there was a large migration of
queer men to cities which helped re-open the queer community to the
general public while also providing queer men access to a larger network
of friends that, in turn, formed a stronger community by the time AIDS
started appearing as a fatal illness for many gay men. While the
community had been joined through sexual encounters and fighting for
equality in the 1970s, in the 1980s, these early bonds changed to
becoming networks of support for AIDS patients and organizations for
advocacy, information, or political activism. Equally, the shift to
advertising and commercializing sex in the 1970s was re-purposed in the
1980s to help organizations and advocates like GMHC (Gay Mens Health
Crisis) and Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz educate gay men about
the risks of unprotected sex and the ways that safer sex could save
lives. GMHC focused on the concept of eroticizing safer sex through
using erotic videos and basing the designs of their safer sex brochures
on sex toy ads.[^3] Callen and Berkowitz attempted to rally and warn the
community through their pamphlet and newspaper article using slang and
erotic terminology instead of medical terms when discussing sex, which
GMHC later incorporated the same technique in their own educational
programming.[^4] The GMHC also, in the early period, sought to use
public sex spaces like bathhouses and backrooms as locations to teach
gay men the benefits of safer sex because they were spaces where sex
occurred and, therefore, could help with reaching large numbers of men
and showing that using condoms and other safer sex methods could still
be considered desirable within these locations.[^5] The idea was if the
places were to continue to exist, they should be places where gay men
could make educated decisions. If sex became safer and was still viewed
as erotic enough to keep baths in business, then AIDS would be reduced
through educational methods created by gay men themselves. Finally,
political groups like ACT UP in New York formed and developed tactics
from those used by gay liberation protests along with those from the
feminist and civil rights movements.[^6] Many of the members of ACT UP
were not part of the previous 1960s and 70s movements but those who were
brought knowledge of how to organize a group, how to get media
attention, and most importantly, how to present a clear message about
what a group is fighting to fix. ACT UP took elements from various
movements and created a successful campaign to fight for treatment
options, medical trial access, and reasonable costs for people with
AIDS. While their protests often verged on the line of respectable and
offensive, and their membership, like most large AIDS organizations, was
predominantly gay white men with money, it is undeniable that ACT UP,
through their use of gay liberation networks and techniques, made a
significant impact on the development of treatment for AIDS much like
how GMHC made significant strides in prevention education through the
use of gay liberation commercialization and eroticization of sex.
