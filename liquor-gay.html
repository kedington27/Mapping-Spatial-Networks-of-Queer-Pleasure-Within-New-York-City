<p>A liquor license is a permit issued by the government for businesses to sell, manufacture, store, or otherwise use alcoholic beverages.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) after Prohibition refused to issue permits to places that homosexuals were known to congregate and if bars were found to be homosexual hot spots their licenses would be removed and they would often be raided. George Chauncey in his book <em>Gay New York</em> describes in detail the process of using licensing as a form of regulation and discrimination on pages 336-352. He says “The genius of the licensing mechanism lay in the way it expanded the states ability to survey and regulate public sociability” because “not only bars but also most restaurants, nightclubs, and cabarets depended on liquor sales to make a profit, the strategy allowed the state to police most of the most common sites of urban sociability.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The legislation backing the SLA did not specify that homosexuality was banned from bars it required “establishments be orderly” and the SLA determined that “the simple presence of lesbians or gay men” made a business disorderly.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Police officers and SLA officials would investigate bars and clubs watching for potential violations of homosexual conduct and if the establishment was found to either be supportive of the behavior or ignoring it the SLA would shut the establishment down and revoke its license. This authority shut down hundreds of gay friendly establishments in New York and all of its actions for decades were supported by the courts leaving the closed establishments with no way of reopening without promising to ban homosexuals.</p>

<p>George Chauncey wrote in detail about two different stories about SLA anti-gay policies that are quoted below. The first story is about the closure of Gloria’s which was a gay bar on Third Avenue at Fortieth Street in 1939 and the second is the license revoking of the Time Square Bar and Grill in the same year. (<em>for the final I will put more of this into my own words/analysis</em>)</p>
<section id="glorias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="glorias">Gloria’s:</h3>
<p>“The owners had made it apparent they wanted to run it as a gay bar by hiring Jackie Mason as its manager. Mason was a well-known figure in gay circles, who had run a gay speakeasy on Charles Street in the mid-1920s (where Jean Malin once worked), had organized the Madison Square Garden drag ball in 1930, and since then had regularly arranged drag shows for both gay and , straight clubs. As one SLA investigator put it, Mason was “a fag and a leader of that element … where Jackie Mason is, fags are”; he was a popular man and a sure draw as a host. Gloria’s was part of a gay bar circuit that included Benny’s, a block to the south; Will Finch described both bars in the spring of 1939 as “very crowded, almost exclusively with homosexuals.” Men felt free to camp it up at Gloria’s. They “sabbed around in feminine voices,” it seemed to one SLA investigator. “Some called others by feminine names. [They] acted, walked, and 7 impersonated females, and [female] attitude and gestures.”” It was precisely this openness that aroused the ire of the police and SLA. The SLA warned Gloria’s management that they had endangered their license by “permit[ting] the premises to become disorderly in permitting homosexuals, degenerates and undesirable people to congregate on the premises.” As the SLA indicated at a hearing, it based this judgment on its investigators’ reports that the bar had hired Mason to attract a gay following and that the men they had seen at the bar behaved in a campy (or “feminine”) manner. The SLA also specified two particular incidents of disorderly conduct witnessed by its agents: a man the agents had invited to the bar had, after a two-hour conversation in a booth, caressed (or “fondled,” as they put it) one of the agents under the table; and the management had permitted two heterosexual couples to goose several homosexual men who had passed by them in the crowded bar. The SLA also alleged that two men had solicited the investigators and that one had offered to arrange a date between an investigator and two “degenerates.” The SLA initially agreed to renew Gloria’s license on the condition that it ban homosexuals from the premises. When the management failed to evict its homosexual patrons, the Authority not only revoked the owner’s license, but prohibited the licensing of the premises - to anyone else for a year, thus making it virtually impossible for the owner to recoup his original investment by selling his equipment.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The owner’s of the bar, unlike many other gay bar owners, took the SLA to court arguing that they had not violated the regulations through attempting to challenge the process the SLA went through to determine who was a homosexual. When that failed they attempted to challenge the policy itself claiming that “the Liquor Authority could not require a bar’s management to ‘refuse to serve such people’” because there was no written section of the law that stated “a sex variant may not be served at a licensed premises.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Both arguments failed and the court upheld the decisions of the SLA which created a precedence for all future cases.</p>

<section id="time-square-bar-and-grill" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-square-bar-and-grill">Time Square Bar and Grill:</h3>
<p>“The fate of the Times Square Garden &amp; Grill is worth detailing, for it illustrates even more effectively than Gloria’s the range of agencies involved in the regulation of bars and the steps they were willing to take to rid commercial establishments of homosexuals. The owner of the Times Square, Morris Horowitz, had not sought a gay. patronage, even though his bar was located on a block (Forty-second Street — between Seventh and Eighth Avenues) that by the mid-thirties had — become a major center of gay bars and male prostitution. But his experience on the Square had alerted him to the risk posed by the gay men who suddenly appeared in his bar. He had seen the SLA close the Barrel ‘House and numerous other neighborhood bars, and he knew that the | advent of the World’s Fair threatened to precipitate even greater police vigilance at the same time that it promised huge profits to the businesses able to cater to the tourist trade. ’You know what it means,’ he , later pleaded before the State Liquor Authority, ‘if I should [lose] that place? .. I know what it means to be on 42 Street in the World’s Fair. ~ Would I take a chance for that?’ He thus quickly contacted the police and military, who he doubtless suspected were already aware of the sit- uation, for assistance in ridding his bar of the homosexuals. A member of the police vice squad who had frequently dealt with ‘fag cases’ visited the bar on two occasions and advised him to try to discourage the gay men’s patronage by putting salt in their drinks or refusing to serve them altogether. But the police and SLA also put the bar under surveillance. An undercover SLA agent who visited the bar filed reports noting that while he had overheard both the manager and bartender indicate their desire to rid the bar of ‘fags,’ they had not in fact done so. The plainclothes policemen who visited the bar used their usual methods to secure definitive evidence that the bar was frequented by ‘degenerates’: they struck up conversations with the other patrons, made arrangements to go home with several of them, and then arrested them as they left the bar, charging them with ‘degenerate disorderly conduct.’ (Five patrons were arrested and convicted; some had their sentences suspended, others spent sixty days in the workhouse.)</p>
<p>A week later, while the bar was still under surveillance by the police and SLA, army officers inspected the premises at the request of the manager and were sufficiently alarmed by the mixing of soldiers and ‘fairies’ there that they raided the bar the following evening (again with the cooperation of the manager) and ordered every soldier to leave. The owner may have thought that this drastic tactic had solved his problem, but he then somehow discovered that the authorities had put his bar under surveillance, despite his efforts to cooperate with them, and he began to panic. After identifying one of the plainclothesmen in the bar, he warned several gay patrons to avoid him, a fact duly noted by the plainclothesman he had not recognized. In retaliation, the police raided the bar, evicted its patrons, and forced it to close. They agreed to let it reopen only on the condition that a uniformed policeman be stationed on the premises to maintain order. Not surprisingly, the policeman’s presence, the two raids, the eviction of the soldiers, and the arrests of patrons by plainclothesmen had the intended effect on the bar’s gay customers: they went away. Nonetheless, the Liquor Authority still decided to revoke the bar’s license on the grounds that it had allowed homosexuals and other people of ‘questionable character’ to congregate on the premises. As a last-ditch effort to save his investment, the owner appealed the revocation to the courts, but his appeal did not question the SLA’s policy against bars that catered to homosexuals. Both the SLA and the bar focused their arguments on whether the manager had engaged in a ‘good faith [effort] to eliminate this condition and … cooperate with the police authorities,’ and the bar owner lost.’</p>
<p>The Times Square Garden &amp; Grill case illustrates the full range of forces that could be brought to bear against gay bars in the city, the extent of the SLA’s commitment to its anti-gay policy, and the futility of most defense strategies available to such bars. It served to warn bar own- ers that they did not need to cultivate a gay patronage in order to suffer the SLA’s wrath: any bar that so much as tolerated the presence of a single homosexual risked losing its license. And in conjunction with the Gloria’s case, it demonstrated that bars had no legal defense against this. policy because the SLA had the full support of the courts. As a result, the SLA faced few legal challenges to its campaign against gay bars for the next fifteen years. It regularly closed both bars that had sought a gay clientele and bars that had served a single gay patron.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-queer-establishments-get-around-this-restriction">How did queer establishments get around this restriction?</h2>
<p>Gay bars and other re-purposed spaced did not disappear from the cityscape when the SLA began their anti-gay crackdowns, however their existence became more hidden and guarded from the public eye. Gay bars and other establishments that served homosexual clientele in the post WWII period were plentiful in the city, but due to the crackdowns by the police and SLA each location was often only open for a short amount of time before being closed and everyone had to go find a new location to use. Some places remained open longer because they either created very strict rules for their patrons to follow inside the space so that there would be no cause to revoke their license or because they were able to bribe the officers to turn a blind-eye to the activities and patrons in their establishment. Chauncey and other scholars of urban gay history argue that it was during this post war period and the height of the SLA that the queer world of New York City moved further underground, but it never fully vanished.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The community just had new rules, new re-purposed locations, and new fears that motivated them to retreat from their pre-war publicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore many New York gay bars during Prohibition and up until before the 1970s were owned and operated by the Mafia due to the discrimination by police and the liquor authorities. Due to the underground, secretive, and crime-entangled nature of the Mafia their ownership allowed gay bars to operate in relative secret within the city, however their treatment of patrons and often strict rules led to feelings of resentment from within the queer community as the 1960s drew to a close.</p>
