title: "AIDS and Public Sex: Debates on Sex Establishments"
---

- What is AIDS?

- When was AIDS first "discovered" in America?

- How did the queer community react to it in the early days? How did scientists?
How did the government?

- What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?

- How do public sex establishments fit into the picture?

  - The use of these spaces became a debate about public health and personal
  freedoms that was at its height from 1982/3 until 1985/6 although the debate
  continued on into the 1990s
  
- Closing public sex establishments as a Public Health measure defended:

  - Shilts, France, Callen, Kramer, newspaper articles
  
- Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:

  - Dangerous Bedfellows, Shilts, GMHC (early period), Patton, Duggan, Chauncey
  Burbe
  
- Were there options to re-purpose public sex establishments within the queer
community?

- Outcomes in New York: bathhouses try to add educational content but in the end
get closed by the city after extreme pressure from a portion of the queer comm-
unity.
