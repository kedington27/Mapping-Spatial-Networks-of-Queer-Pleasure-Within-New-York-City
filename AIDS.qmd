## What is AIDS?

AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) is the last stage of HIV
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection that occurs when the body’s
immune system is badly damaged because of the HIV virus. HIV is a virus
that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person
more vulnerable to other infections and diseases.[^1] HIV/AIDS is spread
through specific bodily fluids like semen and blood. It is now most
often spread during unprotected sex and through sharing needles.

AIDS was connected upon its discovery to gay men but it is important to
mention that it is not only a disease that has and does affect
homosexual men. IV drug users, Haitians, hemophiliacs, blood transfusion
recipients, and children of HIV positive women were all populations
alongside gay men who sought treatment, research, and services for their
health problems. However, since this project's scope is gay men and
their establishments this page will focus primarily on AIDS issues that
effected gay men.

## When was AIDS first "discovered" in America?

AIDS was first "discovered" in America in 1981, however we have evidence
that shows AIDS/HIV had been in the United States since the late
1970s.[^2] AIDS is believed to have come from Africa where it had been
in existence for decades in remote areas. The people there called it the
wasting disease. One of the first known Western cases was Grethe Rask, a
Danish doctor, who worked in Zaire Africa during the 1970s. By 1976 she
was very ill in Africa and by November 1977 she was forced to fly back
to Denmark where she died of *Pneumocysitis carinii* (a type of
pneumonia that typically was not deadly) on December 12, 1977.[^3]

    AIDS Epidemic* (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1987). (need pg).

    referenced it greatly when writing this chunk: Randy Shilts, *And
    the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic* (New
    York: St. Martin’s Press, 1987). 3-7.

In the US some of the earliest cases within the homosexual population
can be traced back to 1979 according to Randy Shilts, IV drug addicts
around the same time began documenting cases of what they called
"junkies pneumonia." It was first officially written about in an MMWR
report in June of 1981 titled "*Pneumocystis* pneumonia in homosexual
men— Los Angeles" which reported on five cases of the illness in the LA
area. It was then followed by “Kaposi’s Sarcoma and *Pneumocystis*
Pneumonia Among Homosexual Men – New York and California” in July of the
same year. However, in these early reports the focus is on the strange
illnesses these young gay men were succumbing to as AIDS itself was
unknown at the time the only thing doctors did understand was that the
immune systems of these men were almost non-existent. Diseases like
Kaposi's Sarcoma, *Pneumocystis carinii* pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, and
toxoplasmosis were therefore considered opportunistic infections that
were the cause of death but not the underlying issue behind these men's
health problems. It was not until the mid-1980s that the HIV virus was
identified as the cause of AIDS.[^4]

## How did the queer community react to it in the early days?

In the early days of the AIDS epidemic the queer community was divided
in its reaction. For those already infected or who knew of other
infected friends and lovers the early period from 1980 until 1983 or so
was one of great fear and loss but also one of activism and action to
create support networks, hotlines, research funds, and safe sex
education that would hopefully slow down transmission. These early
activists in New York City include names like Larry Kramer a gay
playwright who founded the GMHC (Gay Mens Health Crisis) and ACT UP
during AIDS, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz who were some of the
earliest pioneers of gay safer sex education along with Callen being the
face of PWA (People With AIDS) and founding his own self help group
called PWAS, and other early GMHC members like Paul Popham who was their
first President.

However, in these early years the vast majority of the gay population of
New York City was a mix of unaware or in denial about the seriousness of
AIDS due to mixed press coverage, lack of government intervention, and
the feeling of gay liberation and being young and invisible. These men
took longer to convince that AIDS was a big deal but through
organizations like GMHC by 1983/84 more gay men were aware of the
epidemic and most men began to know people who died which also increased
awareness and fear. The community during this period generally came
together and worked to support those with AIDS while also trying to keep
people safe without knowing how the virus spread.

## How did scientists react to it in the early days?

Scientists at the CDC and doctors who served large gay populations in
NYC and California were called into action very early on during the AIDS
epidemic. The CDC was there from day one of the MMRW report and doctors
like (insert guy from San Fran) and Joseph Sonnabend were some of the
first to report cases and attempt treatment of the opportunistic
infections. The CDC in the first few years spent its time doing
epidemiology research to track and determine possible causes for the
virus along with researching in labs causes and potential treatments.
Their early theories are listed below but because their focus was on gay
men and when they interviewed these men and found out that they were all
highly sexually active and also did drugs most of the early theories
focused on drug use and "promiscuity." Their interviewing while at times
misleading did lead CDC scientists to hypothesize that the disease was
spread through sexual contact and more specifically through bodily
fluids like blood. Doctors in the early period attempted treatment and
accepted patients in high numbers, however as cases continued to rise
and AIDS was connected to gay men some hospitals stopped accepting
patients with AIDS symptoms which led to increased discrimination and
medical issues for PWA.

At the same time, the stigma AIDS gained made some scientists wary of
working on the disease and made the government reluctant to provide
funding to the CDC, NIH, and other hospitals and scientists for
research. These set backs frustrated scientists at the CDC like Don
Frances and Robert Gallo at the NIH because it delayed crucial progress
when the government had previously thrown money into research about
toxic shock syndrome and Legionaries disease quickly because those
diseases were not associated with a minority group that had significant
stigma attached to it during a conservative time in American history.
However by the end of 1983 Robert Gallo had identified HIV as the cause
of AIDS and by 1984/5 the public was also aware of this development.

## How did the government react to it in the early days?

The best way to describe government reactions to the early AIDS crisis
is that there was really no major reaction. The government was aware of
AIDS in 1981, however Ronald Reagan had just taken office and the
government itself was leaning far more conservative in the years leading
up to AIDS with the rise of the Moral Majority to power and the failures
of Jimmy Carter at the end of the 70s. Gay rights and protections of
homosexuals was far down on the list of priorities for Reagan and his
staff when AIDS hit the news. The government provided some money and
resources to the CDC and other researchers but it was slim.

The President and his staff offered no public statements on the epidemic
until the late 1980s leaving many AIDS patients and their friends and
family feeling neglected by the government and local AIDS organizations
were founded to fill the needs of the people that the government was
ignoring but these organizations were often overwhelmed by the needs of
PWA during the early years. The government also released no advice about
prevention or treatment outside of CDC publications which caused mass
confusion and ignorance in the years that it mattered most as even
though a few gay men put out their own advice about AIDS prevention and
public health actions, such as the need to close bathhouses, most people
were skeptical to make changes without scientific and governmental
proof. The Surgeon General Everet Koop did not release advice on AIDS to
the general public until 1988 when he pushed for publication of the
pamphlet "Understanding AIDS" that caused him major backlash within the
Republican Party.

## What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?

Poppers: The CDC in the early days of their investigation in 1981
proposed the theory that poppers might be linked to AIDS. This
conclusion was made because all of the first reported cases that they
saw as linked were gay men who upon their interviews admitted to "sexual
promiscuity" along with taking party drugs and sex aids like poppers.
Poppers are inhaled and are known to relax muscles and to create a short
lived high for users. They mess with the blood stream and veins so the
CDC thought prolonged use might cause KS to develop, which was a common
symptom in early patients. This theory remained in circulation until
1985 when it was determined that AIDS was caused by the HIV virus.
However, some people still attribute poppers to KS and AIDS.

-   promiscuity

-   blood/virus

-   multi-causal through various STI's

-   drugs

-   more obscure theories about Haitian pigs, mental illness, and
    self hatred
```

## How do public sex establishments fit into the picture?

```         
-   The use of these spaces became a debate about public health and
    personal freedoms that was at its height from 1982/3 until
    1985/6 although the debate continued on into the 1990s

## Closing public sex establishments as a Public Health measure defended:

```         
-   Shilts, France, Callen, Kramer, newspaper articles
```

## Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:

```         
-   Dangerous Bedfellows, Shilts, GMHC (early period), Patton,
    Duggan, Chauncey Burbe
```

## Were there options to re-purpose public sex establishments within the queer community?

The short answer is yes there were options proposed within the queer
community to re-purpose public sex establishments like bathhouses and
backroom bars during the height of the AIDS epidemic. One option that
was talked about mainly by the pro-public sex side of the debate was the
option for increased regulation of these spaces ranging from workers who
would keep an eye on sexual activity and remove those who were being
unsafe to turning more lights on so people could see if they were with
someone with KS lesions. The other option that was offered and attempted
was to use these sex locations as educational opportunities to teach gay
men safer sex techniques.

The debates about closing bathhouses in New York City ended for a short
time through the compromise created by the GMHC that proposed that
bathhouses could operate with their support if they adopted safer sex
practices and encouraged education and safety in their establishments
starting in 1983/4. Many of the bathhouses agreed to this system that
combined elements of both restriction and education. Michael Callen,
once a frequent visitor to the baths, was tasked with conducting
inspections of these establishments and grading them on their
compliance. What you see below are photos of one of his inspection
reports. The report shows that while there was some improvement in these
locations displaying safer sex posters, offering condoms, turning on
lights, and cleaning the majority of places were not holding up their
end of the bargain because it was costing them customers. It is not for
lack of trying that the bathhouses and backrooms were ultimately closed
in 1985 in NYC as there were multiple attempts to have them regulated
and made into safer spaces where sex could be had in safer but still
erotic ways in places dedicated to homosexual safety.

## Outcomes in New York:

As stated above the bathhouses of New York City along with the backroom
bars were all closed in 1985, some managed to reopen later on but they
never gained the popularity back the way it had been in the 1970s and
80s. The attempts to use them for educational purposes by GMHC were
successful sometimes and sometimes they were a bust. It was not for lack
of trying that the attempts at compromise to keep these historic gay
spaces open failed but rather because these business owners were
unwilling to give up profits for philanthropic causes and gay men who
went to the establishments were unlikely to listen to safer sex advice
posters unless they were already scared or curious, especially by 1985.
Leading figures in gay activism fought to get these locations closed
even when there were moments of compromise and potential success with
Michael Callen being one of the biggest proponents of closure. Due to
intense pressure from both the scientific and queer communities by 1985
there was enough evidence for the major of New York to officially shut
down the baths.
