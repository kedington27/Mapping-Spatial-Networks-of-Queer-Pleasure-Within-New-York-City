## What is AIDS?

AIDS is the last stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune 
system is badly damaged because of the HIV virus. HIV is a virus that attacks 
cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to 
other infections and diseases.[^1] HIV/AIDS is spread through specific bodily 
fluids like semen and blood. It is now most often spread during unprotected sex 
and through sharing needles.

## When was AIDS first "discovered" in America?

AIDS was first "discovered" in America in 1981, however we have evidence that 
shows AIDS/HIV had been in the United States since the late 1970s.[^2]

## How did the queer community react to it in the early days? How did scientists? How did the government?

    -   Need to add in this

## What were early theories about how AIDS was transmitted?

Poppers: The CDC in the early days of their investigation in 1981 proposed the 
theory that poppers might be linked to AIDS. This conclusion was made because 
all of the first reported cases that they saw as linked were gay men who upon their
interviews admitted to "sexual promiscuity" along with taking party drugs and sex
aids like poppers. Poppers are inhaled and are known to relax muscles and to create
a short lived high for users. They mess with the blood stream and veins so the CDC
thought prolonged use might cause KS to develop, which was a common symptom in early
patients. This theory remained in circulation until 1985 when it was determined
that AIDS was caused by the HIV virus. However, some people still attribute poppers
to KS and AIDS. (Use Zmith and Shilts for more details)

    -   promiscuity

    -   blood/virus

    -   multi-causal through various STI's

    -   drugs

    -   more obscure theories about Haitian pigs, mental illness, and
        self hatred

## How do public sex establishments fit into the picture?

    -   The use of these spaces became a debate about public health and
        personal freedoms that was at its height from 1982/3 until
        1985/6 although the debate continued on into the 1990s

## Closing public sex establishments as a Public Health measure defended:

    -   Shilts, France, Callen, Kramer, newspaper articles

## Personal freedom to attend public sex establishments defended:

    -   Dangerous Bedfellows, Shilts, GMHC (early period), Patton,
        Duggan, Chauncey Burbe

## Were there options to re-purpose public sex establishments within the queer community?

    -   educational options

    -   increased regulations within spaces

## Outcomes in New York: 
  bathhouses try to add educational content but in the end get closed by the 
  city after extreme pressure from a portion of the queer community.
