Kylie Edington:

I am currently a Graduate Student at Virginia Tech '25. I am in my second year of the History MA program, and my main research area is within the gender and sexuality framework. I am interested in queer history, histories of gender and sexuality, and the concepts of enjoyment and pleasure. I want to learn and explore new groups and find the moments of everyday pleasure in their lives to highlight the fun, freedoms, and opportunities people had in the past. Therefore, my current MA research projects both center on queer people in urban New York in the late 1900s, where they went to socialize and seek pleasure, and how they fought to find new ways to pursue sexual pleasure during the AIDS crisis.
